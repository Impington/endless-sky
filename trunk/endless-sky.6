.SH NAME
endless-sky \- a space exploration and combat game.

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBendless-sky\fR [-h] [--help] [-v] [--version] [-l] [--load] [-t] [--table] [-r] [--resources] [-c] [--config]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBEndless Sky\fR is a space exploration and combat game combining action and role playing elements.

Explore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own.

For keyboard controls, click the "Preferences" button on the title screen. You can pause and return to the title screen at any point in the game by pressing <escape>.

Most of the controls should be self-explanatory. Your ship has no reverse thrusters, so as with a real spacecraft, the only way to slow down is to turn your ship around and accelerate in the opposite direction from your current heading. To assist with some tricky maneuvers, your ship hs an autopilot which engages when you press 'L' to land or 'H' to enter hyperspace; the autopilot disengages if you press any of the movement keys. The autopilot will also automatically aim your ship if you are firing a weapon and have a target selected.

When run from the command line, if a resource directory is not specified, the program will check to see if the current directory contains directories named "data" and "images" and files named "keys.txt" and "credits.txt"; if so it will read resources from the current directory. Otherwise it will use /usr/local/share/endless-sky if it exists, or /usr/share/endless-sky otherwise.
