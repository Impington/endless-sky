The Act was Parliament's response, stating that taking goods from a human being is piracy, but if the owner or some living representative of theirs is not present in system, taking those goods is a legal salvage operation. The point was to keep the Navy from being obligated to defend every equipment cache or abandoned station in the galaxy.

We had six months or so to move two million settlers off-world before the temperatures would drop too low to be livable. More than half of the Navy was mobilized to ferry our people to other planets."`
			`	"Here's the best part," says Eyes. "The Navy operates with a certain amount of autonomy. Turns out when they found out about the disaster, they mobilized without even waiting to clear it with Parliament. Which was technically within their mandate, this being a natural disaster. But the Navy is funded by taxes, and the Paradise Planets pay ten times as much in taxes as the Dirt Belt."`
			`	"The Paradise Planets viewed the Navy as their own private security force," says Katya, "so they got really mad when half the Navy suddenly vanished to assist some dirty refugees. Because those generals gave the order to assist us, millions of lives were saved. And then Parliament fired them."`

			`	"I was a child on Vinci while this was happening," says Eyes. "A paradise world. I would listen to the news and could never understand why all the adults around me were so very, very angry that the Navy had gone off to rescue two million people from freezing to death. But they told me that we lived in one little island of safety in a dangerous galaxy, and that without the Navy protecting us the pirates or even maybe aliens would sweep in and destroy our homes and take our money. That is was us against the whole galaxy."`

			`	Katya says, "Ever since this conflict began, southern space has been swarming not only with an increased militia presence, but with the whole Republic Navy. That must make it awfully hard to be a pirate. Seems like the pirates would be glad if the Navy got what they were looking for and went back up north."`

From all oppression, conspiracy, and rebellion; from violence, battle, and murder; and from dying suddenly and unprepared, good Lord, deliver us..." It's very monotonous.`
