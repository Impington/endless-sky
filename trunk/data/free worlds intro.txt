It's hard to believe that we can find the attackers before they do, unless they're somewhere the Navy hasn't thought to look."`
			`	"Agreed," says Eyes, "And to make matters worse, their sensors are probably much better than mine."`
			`	Katya appears to be struck by a sudden idea. "The sensors on their drones," she says, "their unmanned drones..."`
			`	Eyes glances at her, sees her expression, and says, "No, councilor, don't even think of it. That's a horrible idea."`
			`	"No," she says, "it's brilliant. Captain <last>, are you familiar with the Dereliction and Salvage Act of 2976?"`

				`	"Well then," she says, "you'll probably agree that legally speaking, Navy surveillance drones count as abandoned goods the moment their owners have left the system."`
				goto response

			`	"Well," she says, "it started when the Syndicate began experimenting with fully automated mining facilities on uninhabitable planets. Pirates started raiding the mines to steal equipment, and the Syndicate claimed that these installations were 'colonies' and it was the Navy's job to defend them. The Act was Parliament's response, stating that taking goods from a human being is piracy, but if the owner or some living representative of theirs is not present in system, taking those goods is a legal salvage operation. The point was to keep the Navy from being obligated to defend every equipment cache or abandoned station in the galaxy. But by the same law, those Navy surveillance drones become abandoned goods the moment their motherships leave the system."`

			`You join Katya and Mr. Eyes in the restaurant, and order your meals. They are both in high spirits. While you are waiting for the food to arrive, Mr. Eyes raises his glass of wine and says, "A toast, to Captain <last> and our marvelous new toy. May it bring us good information and swift justice."`
			`	"We're thinking that while we're in the area, we should stop on <planet> next," says Katya, "And then work our way toward the Rim."`
			`	Your meals arrive. The food is excellent, and you spend a relaxed evening sharing stories of your childhoods. Katya turns out to be a Dirt Belt native like yourself, from a planet named Hope. "No longer settled," she explains, "Supervolcano. It was a cold planet to start out with, and the eruption sent it into an ice age that could last for millenia. My home town is under thirty meters of glacier by now."`
			choice
				`	"Was anyone killed?"`
				`	"How did you escape?"`
			
			`	"The eruption was on the other continent," she explains, "So no one was killed in the blast. It was a slow-moving disaster. We had six months or so to move two million settlers off-world before the temperatures would drop too low to be livable. More than half of the Navy was mobilized to ferry our people to other planets."`
			`	"Here's the best part," says Eyes. "The Navy operates with a certain amount of autonomy. Turns out when they found out about the disaster, they mobilized without even waiting to clear it with Parliament. Which was technically within their mandate, this being a natural disaster. But the Navy is funded by taxes, and the Paradise Planets pay ten times as much in taxes as the Dirt Belt."`
			`	"The Paradise Planets viewed the Navy as their own private security force," says Katya, "so they got really mad when half the Navy suddenly vanished to assist some dirty refugees. Because those generals gave the order to assist us, millions of lives were saved. And then Parliament fired them."`
			choice
				`	"You're making the Navy sound like heros. I thought they were your enemies."`
				`	"You've almost convinced me to join the Navy."`
			
			`	"Our fight isn't with the Navy," says Katya. "Most of them are good people. I'm sure they don't want war any more than we do. They're like police officers who are suddenly being asked to fight against the very people they swore to protect and serve."`
			`	"I was a child on Vinci while this was happening," says Eyes. "A paradise world. I would listen to the news and could never understand why all the adults around me were so very, very angry that the Navy had gone off to rescue two million people from freezing to death. But they told me that we lived in one little island of safety in a dangerous galaxy, and that without the Navy protecting us the pirates or even maybe aliens would sweep in and destroy our homes and take our money. That is was us against the whole galaxy."`
			`	"I'd hate to be rich," says Katya. "So much to fear."`
			`	You finish your meal (Katya pays the tab), and agree to take off for <planet> first thing in the morning.`
