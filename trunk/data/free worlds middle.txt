			`The ships in orbit are eliminated, but there are still the Alphas and their servants here on the ground to take care of. Your escorts unload the troops, who spread throughout the city and quickly determine that, as far as the locals know, the Alphas are all holed up in a large factory on the outskirts of town. The locals also inform you that the Alphas have taken dozens of prisoners and are holding them in the factory.`
			`	As you are trying to prepare the Free Worlds troops to storm the building, suddenly one of your escorts, the Starry Warrior, takes off. You radio the captain, who responds, "Sorry, Captain, but I'm following orders. Alondo suspected you wouldn't like this." Then he opens fire on the factory, destroying everything within several blocks with blaster fire and torpedoes. He does not stop firing until there is nothing left but smoldering rubble in that entire section of the city.`
			`	The Alphas are presumably dead. So are their prisoners, and any of the locals who were unlucky enough to be close to the factory when it was destroyed. The governor of Poisonwood, unable to conceal his anger, asks you to take your troops and your ships and leave his world immediately.`

Outside, a storm is raging, the rain mixing with salt spray from the blood-red ocean nearby.`
			`	As you talk, it becomes clear that the inhabitants of Bloodsea are ashamed of how destitute and undeveloped their world is. Several of them have visited the island spaceport on Deep, and after dancing around the issue for a while, they make a request: if the Free Worlds builds them a real, modern island spaceport, they will join the Free Worlds.`
			`	One of them lays out a detailed list of amenities the port must have: concrete seawalls, raised landing pads, floating docks, sturdy hangars and warehouses, and various defense systems "for when the others learn that we've decided to join you." Also, the deal is off if you show up in orbit with a fleet that "looks like an invasion fleet rather than a construction fleet."`
