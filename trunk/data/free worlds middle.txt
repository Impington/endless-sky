			`	"Another three worlds have secretly told us they are ready to defect," says Alondo, "and this time around we want to get there before the Navy does."`
			`	Freya says, "We need you to take Alondo, along with the ships that we've been able to muster, and fly through the Seginus and Alphecca systems, then land on <destination>. If all goes well, you will get through to <planet> before the Republic can muster reinforcements. Drive off any Republic ships you encounter along the way."`

			`You wait in the spaceport bar for a while. Your Free Worlds uniform has drawn a good deal of attention from the locals: a few of them waved to you when you came in, or gave other subtle signs of approval, but no one is sitting with you. They probably want to avoid getting into trouble with the Republic if the Free Worlds is not able to hold this planet.`

			choice
				`	"Is everything okay?"`
				`	"Did they agree to join us?"`
			`	"Yes, yes, of course," he says. "But taking on six more worlds all of a sudden - I just hope it's not more than we can handle. When the Navy recovers from the battle at Rastaban and strikes back, now we have much less idea where that strike will fall."`
			`	"So, what do we do next?" you ask.`
			`	"We need to move more of our fleet up here to the front," he says, "but I'd be willing to bet that the Navy has installed surveillance equipment on Hope, and maybe a few other planets in this sector too. Which I should have though of before, because in order to be sure we've tracked every last one down, we need Freya's expertise in signals and sensors. So, I'm sending you to meet up with her."`
			choice
				`	"No problem. Don't worry, we'll be able to handle this just fine."`
					accept
				`	"Aren't you afraid the Navy will strike while I'm off fetching her?"`
			`	"Of course," he says. "But I talked with JJ, and he thinks they're still recovering from the last battle. And if their sensors all go dark, that will be a big deterrent to keep them from attacking - certainly more of a deterrent than you could add by staying here with our fleet."`
			`	"Understood," you say. "I'll go get Freya."`

			`As you approach the planet, Freya sits down at your ship's sensor console and begins fiddling with some settings that you didn't even know existed. She seems entirely focused, and clearly knows what she is doing. You recall being told that she is an engineer, not a politician or a military commander, which makes the fact that she has been able to step up as such a strong leader in the Council very impressive.`
			`	"Yup, eight different stations," she says finally, "including this one that I nearly overlooked, buried twenty feet under the ice, that is acting as a relay for them." She points out each station on your map, and you fly by each one and destroy it. "Now," she says, "that was what had me most worried, but for the sake of completeness we should sweep the other new worlds, too. Let's go to <planet> next."`

			`	Warily, you approach the sensor installation, kicking down the door to an old abandoned warehouse. Freya is right - it's not guarded. She shuts down the transmitter, then asks for your help bringing some of the sensors and other equipment back to your ship. "I always love having a chance to look at Navy technology," she says. "Now, let's head to <planet>."`

			`As you approach <origin>, Freya quickly locates two Navy surveillance stations and contacts Alondo, asking him to send some Free Worlds personnel to destroy them. Then you land, and Alondo comes aboard your ship to discuss your next steps in person.`
			`	"There's a good chance we've taken care of all the sensors in this sector," says Freya, "so we can start moving our fleets around here without tipping the Navy off. And I just heard from Southbound Shipping that they've got two more Dreadnoughts ready for service."`

I wish we could throw you a big dinner or something to celebrate, but... well, we're all busy with the war right now. But Alondo and JJ both said to tell you they're glad to have you on board. And you'll get a salary increase, of course. Which you ought to celebrate by buying us both a few drinks in the spaceport bar before you leave. Okay?"`
