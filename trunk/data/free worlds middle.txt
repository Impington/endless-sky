Which is why we took the liberty of forwarding this picture to the Navy." As he is speaking, a shadow passes overhead.

			`	The Navy ship lands, and a man steps off who you recognize immediately: General William Danforth, who is something of a folk hero throughout human space. With him is a man who he introduces as Commander Aaron Nguyen of the Navy Humanitarian Corps. Nguyen shakes your hand, and you are struck by the fact that although he is your enemy, you see no trace of hostility in his eyes - in fact, his expression is oddly warm and affectionate.`
			`	"We have no room for error," says Danforth. "These Alphas must be eliminated, and they must not be allowed to escape. On that, at least, we can all agree."`
			`	Freya says, "Captain <last> will lead the attack." She beckons to two of the Free Worlds captains. "Marco, Emily, you will join them with your Falcons. Destroy any pirate ships in orbit, then land and secure the facility. Understood?" You nod, and prepare to take off for the <system> system.`

The Navy troops move with far more precision and purpose than you have ever seen among the poorly trained Free Worlds soldiers.`
			`	They sweep the city and quickly ascertain that the Alphas are holed up in a large factory. The troops encircle the building and burst through the doors, and soon you hear the sounds of explosions and gunfire within. You wait with Commander Nguyen in an alley facing the building. "I'm with the Humanitarian Corps," he explains. "Killing things is not in my job description."`
			`	Just then, one of the second floor windows shatters and a figure comes tumbling out, rolls, and starts running in your direction. Then it does something you would swear no human being is capable of: while still moving in your direction, it begins leaping from one wall of the alley to the other as easily as you would run up a staircase, gaining altitude with each jump so that soon it will pass two or three meters above your heads. Several Navy troops are running after it, but they hold their fire to avoid hitting you and Nguyen.`

			`When you meet up with Nguyen, he still looks very worried. "We think we killed them all," he says, "but we can't be sure. Also, we recovered some instruments for genetic manipulation from the factory. The Alphas can't breed normally, because if their offspring inherit some of the Alpha mutations but not others, the result is rarely viable, and even those that live long enough to be born don't have all the Alpha traits. So, they rely on artificial insemination instead."`

It's the only safe decision, but I still don't like it." He sighs. "I'm a Buddhist, you know. Committed to doing harm to no living thing. That's why I joined the Humanitarian Corps.

Far better for them to die than for that to happen. Anyways, that's my job to deal with; you need to go find Danforth."`

The locals also inform you that the Alphas have taken dozens of prisoners and are holding them in the factory.`

			`As soon as you land on New Tibet, JJ meets up with you. "Alphas on Poisonwood," he says. "A new Navy base in Kaus Borealis. Half our fleet still down for repairs. We're stretched way too thin here, and it's showing. This is why I was so hesitant to expand our territory."`
			`	As he is speaking, a single ship comes streaking down towards the spaceport, moving much too fast to land properly. It overshoots the landing pad, and skids for about a hundred meters through the dirt before coming to a stop. You recognize it as an Arrow class executive transport, a scout ship used mostly in Syndicate space. "What now?" says JJ, as you both run towards the ship.`
			`	A man runs out of the ship, carrying a suitcase that appears to be very heavy. A few seconds later, several more ships swoop down towards the spaceport: Syndicate Quicksilvers. One of them fires on the Arrow transport, destroying it. The man dives for cover behind one of the spaceport buildings. JJ pulls a radio out of his pocket, switches it to the broadcast frequency, and begins shouting, "What the hell is going on here? You're in Free Worlds space."`
			`	The radio crackles, and a man's voice says, "We are pursuing a dangerous criminal. Syndicate security forces will be landing shortly to apprehend him. Please do not interfere with us, and do not approach the criminal. He is extremely dangerous."`
			`	JJ shuts the radio off and asks you, "Was that man carrying a weapon?"`

He draws a gun when he sees you coming, then lowers it when you get close enough for him to see your uniforms. He beckons to you to follow, then ducks into the building. As you follow him, several shots ring out behind you: the Syndicate security forces, approaching quickly.`
			`	A second later, there is an earth-shaking roar as Danforth's Navy cruiser, the Peacemaker, lifts off and begins flying toward you. Danforth's voice booms out over the ship's external speakers: "Syndicate troops, drop your weapons and stand down immediately, or you will be destroyed." JJ shoots a quick glance at you, and you can tell that he is totally bewildered by what is going on.`
			`	The fugitive waves the suitcase and shouts, "The Syndicate built the nukes! The attack on Geminus! I have evidence!" A second later, two men in Syndicate uniforms run into the building and open fire on him. The fugitive dives behind a pile of crates, but you hear him shout in pain; he has been hit. You have only a split second to make a decision that could have extreme repercussions...`

					goto stop

				`	You stand aside as the Syndicate security officers run behind the stack of crates. You hear three gunshots, then the officers walk out from behind the crates and out the door without saying a word to you. One of them is carrying the suitcase. As they leave, you hear the other one speak into his radio: "All units, return to your ships."`
				`	The Syndicate ships depart. The fugitive is dead, and whatever evidence he was carrying is gone.`
					decline
			label stop
			`	You draw your gun and point it at the Syndicate troops. JJ does the same. "Drop your weapons," you say. Reluctantly, they lay down their rifles. A few seconds later, a shadow falls across the doorway: it is one of Danforth's battle-armored soldiers, and his gun is pointed at the Syndicate officers. With them safely disarmed, you hurry to check on the fugitive. He is alive, but is bleeding profusely from a wound in his thigh.`
			`	Ten minutes later, you've stopped the fugitive's bleeding with a tourniquet, and Danforth's troops have seized control of the spaceport. JJ does not seem too happy with this turn of events, but he orders his ships not to attack Danforth's cruiser. You take the fugitive to the local Free Worlds infirmary. Danforth meets up with you there, and you are all about to begin questioning the fugitive when Danforth's communicator beeps and a voice says, "Sir, we're picking up more Syndicate ships incoming."`
			`	Danforth swears. "Captain <last>," he says, "get to your ship and help drive them off. I'll make sure the ones on the ground stay pacified." You hurry back to your ship, and take off with a hastily assembled fleet of defenders...`

			`	Danforth's voice replies, "Not yet. First, I need you to allow another Oathkeeper vessel to land. A gunboat. You should see it incoming soon."`

Even the 'whites' of her eyes are black: when she gets closer, you can see that it is actually a scleric tattoo, an intricate Celtic knotwork pattern inked into the whites of her eyes.

Hesitantly, he takes her hands. It's an oddly intimate scene, the two of them quietly holding hands and locking eyes - not like any interrogation you have seen before. "Now," she says, "tell me your story."`
			`	"My name is Sawyer," says the man. "I'm a physicist, a Syndicate employee. We had a secret project on Mutiny, a planet in a pirate system. We were developing nuclear weapons." He hesitates, and looks away for a second, then says, "They told me it was for fighting the pirates. I didn't realize otherwise until-"`
			`	"That is a lie," says Raven, calmly.`
			`	He seems flustered. "Okay, they didn't tell me what the weapons were for, and I didn't ask."`
			choice
				`	"Why would the Syndicate attack the Republic?"`
				`	"Why did you wait so long to report this?"`
					goto wait
			`	They both seem surprised at you asking a question. "I don't know," says Sawyer, "But the Syndicate's profits have more than doubled since this war began. Maybe they knew they would benefit from it more than anyone."`
			`	"What led you to report this?" asks Raven.`
			label wait
			`	He says, "It was when I heard that there had been another major battle. Up until then I had been telling myself that the worst of the damage was done. But after that battle, I knew that millions more could die because of our crime, and that I had the power to stop it."`
			`	Raven continues to ask questions: who was involved, how the facility was hidden, where the raw materials come from. At one point, JJ pulls you aside and says, "She must be a Questioner. How they operate is a tightly kept secret. I'd always assumed their methods were... a bit more medieval."`
			`	Finally, Raven is satisfied, and radios her ship. "He's telling the truth," she tells them. "Send word to the generals at once." Then she turns to you and JJ and says, "You probably have a lot of questions. Meet me back at the spaceport in an hour."`
