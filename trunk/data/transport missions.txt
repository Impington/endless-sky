Like many of the locals, they are both wearing dust masks over their mouths, and the woman is also wearing goggles."

			"	The couple introduces themselves as George and Samantha. As you shake hands with them, you notice that Samatha's eyes under the goggles are rimmed in red, and she keeps coughing quietly: a dry, careful cough. George explains that they came here several years ago to take jobs in the factories, but the volcanic fumes have been giving Samantha trouble ever since they arrived. They will pay for transport for themselves and their household goods to <destination>."

			"As you walk through the spaceport, you hear a voice behind you, saying, ''Excuse me, captain.'' You turn around and see a woman trying to flag you down. Her hairdo is tall and somewhat confusing; her high heels are also tall and are giving her considerable trouble as she walks towards you."
			"	''You look like the sort of captain I can trust,'' she says. ''My darling Pookie has been visiting her aunt on Shroud, and it's time for her to come home, but she's not used to space travel and it scares her. I would feel so much better if you could go pick her up and bring her back here. Can you do that for me?'' You can't help noticing that the jewelry she's wearing probably costs as much as a small fighter craft. This job sounds easy, and has the potential to be quite lucrative."

The shop is not hard to find; the mannequins in the window look like feral sheep with overgrown wool in bad need of grooming."
			"	The only person standing outside the shop is a tall woman in a suit who is busy making furious marks on some sort of document with a red pen. She has a small poodle on a leash; it is busy nipping the heels of everyone who walks by."

			"	''Thank heavens,'' she says. ''She's all yours.'' She hands you the leash and a large bag that appears to be full of chew toys. ''Here are her toys, her food, and her... outfits. Which she hates. Feed her twice a day, or she will go berserk. Do not feed her more than twice a day, or she will throw up...''"
			"	As she continues rattling off instructions, you ask, ''Wait, Pookie is the dog?''"
			"	''Short for 'Pocahontas,''' she explains. ''Good luck, and I hope my sister pays you well.'' She walks away. There's nothing else you can do but bring Pookie back to your ship, where she immediately lifts her leg against the landing strut."
