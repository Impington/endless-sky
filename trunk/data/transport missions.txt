			`	You ask, "How much can you pay?"`

We don't get paid anything unless they agree to let us go. Which isn't going to happen. But if you help us start a new life, we'll work hard and some day we'll pay you back.

			`	You've heard of these service passageways: the most dangerous part of this lawless station, dimly lit and seldom travelled, except by drug addicts and prostitutes. This whole thing might just be a ruse to lure you into one, where they can attack you without anyone interfering. "No," says the boy, "If we head for the service tunnel, they'll be sure to notice us. Let's just stay at the table until they go away."`

			`	"Let's try the tunnel," you say.`
			`	The boy stands up. "Wait ten seconds, then head to the tunnel," he says. He walks into the bathroom, which is right next to back entrance that she pointed out. You wait for a few seconds, then stand up and head for the service tunnel. "Don't run," says the girl, "Walk slowly. Pretend. You've had a bit too much to drink. We're headed out back to find some privacy." You don't dare look behind you to see if the men in the doorway are watching you.`
			`	Finally, you reach the back entrance. It's an old-fashioned airtight door, in case the service tunnel depressurizes. She spins the wheel to unlock it, and then gives it a yank. The hinges squeal, but it opens enough for you to squeeze through. You find yourselves in a narrow corridor lit only by flickering sodium lamps. In the yellow lamplight her face and hands look pale, jaundiced. The floor of the corridor is littered with beer bottles and discarded hypodermic needles. To one side of the door are several over-stuffed trash cans. As you step into the corridor, a rat scurries away into the darkness.`
			`	A few second later, watching through the open airlock, you see the boy walk out of the bathroom. He can't help stealing a quick glance towards the men in the doorway, after which he quickly ducks through the airlock and slams the door shut. "Run!" he whispers.`
			`	You begin running down the corridor, in the direction of your ship. You pass a man, slumped over in a corner; there is no time to see if he is dead, or just sleeping. In places the lights have gone out, and it is so dim that you can barely see the floor beneath you. Your footsteps pounding on the metal decking ring terribly loud up and down the empty hallway. You cannot tell if the sound of more footsteps behind you is just an echo, or someone following you.`
			`	Eventually the passageway widens out into some sort of maintenance room, with large tanks and humming equipment lining the walls. There are also several small, windowless sheds. You duck behind one of them and listen for sounds of pursuit. You hear nothing. "I think we're safe," says the boy. He walks over to another airlock door on the opposite wall and tugs it open. Light pours in, almost blinding at first. You are looking out into the the rimway, the main passage in this ring of the station. Crowds of people are walking past, paying no attention to you. He glances quickly in both directions, then gestures for you to follow.`
				goto ship
			
			label outside
			`	You wait at the table, playing with the computer terminal at the center of it, pretending that you are busy placing a drink order. The men at the door do not leave. Instead, they step into the room and begin circling around the edge of it. Fortunately, right now they are headed away from you. "What berth is your ship in?" asks the boy. You tell him. "Wait ten seconds, then follow," he says. He stands up and walks through the door. The searchers glance at him as he leaves, but they must be looking for two people together, because they ignore him.`
			`	The searchers approach the bar and begin talking to one of the bartenders. You and the girl stand up. "Walk slowly," she hisses under her breath, "Saunter. Don't run." You put an arm around her shoulders and do your best to act like an ordinary bar patron headed home with a new friend after having a bit too much to drink. You don't dare to glance at the bar to see if you are being watched.`
			`	Finally you reach the door. You are in the rimway, the main passage in this ring of the station. It is crowded and brightly lit. You quicken your pace slightly and begin walking toward your ship, still afraid that if you break into a run, you will attract attention. The girl keeps glancing at the shop windows that you pass by: checking the reflection for anyone following you. "They're leaving the bar," she says, and then, "They're walking in the other direction. I think we're safe."`
			`	You pass a narrow doorway, probably an entrance to one of the service tunnels. The boy is standing there, holding a gun by his side. His grim expression softens somewhat when he sees you approaching. He looks out behind you, scanning the crowd, then steps out of the doorway to follow you.`
				goto ship
			
			label ship
			`	You quickly make your way back to your ship. As soon as the door has closed behind you, all three of you breathe a sigh of relief. A second later, the baby begins to wail, loudly. As you show them to their bunks, they introduce themselves as Joe and Maria; the baby's name is Jesse. "I don't know how to thank you," says Maria.`
			`	"Please don't take too long leaving the station," adds Joe. "But, I think we'll be safe here until you're ready to leave. There's no way they can search all the ships on the dock."`

			`You return to the lab where you dropped off the anonymous archaeologist. Soon after you arrive, he appears and eagerly collects the two samples, giving you a payment of <payment> for your troubles. "But please," he says, "stick around long enough to learn the results." He hands the two envelopes to a lab technologist, and says, "Here you go, John, Take a look and let us know what you find."`
			`	After the lab tech leaves, he explains, "You see, the ratio of Carbon 12 to Carbon 14 varies from world to world, so accurate dating can only be done if you have a control sample to compare against. Only a handful of archaeological studies have been done in the Deep, and those were sloppy - they used the standard tables of Earth's carbon ratios instead of determining the local concentrations."`
			`	About thirty minutes later, John reappears, looking somewhat shaken. "Where did you get those samples?" he asks.`
			`	"Never mind that," says the archaeologist. "What are your results?"`
			`	"The second sample contains some sort of oil or tar," he says. "A varnish. And therefore it is from furniture or a building. A man-made artifact. The control sample has an isotopic ratio different from Earth, so unless you're playing some game with me, these samples are not from Earth."`
			`	"Go on," says the archaeologist.`
			`	"However," says the lab tech, "again assuming the two samples are from the same planet, the second sample is between fifteen hundred and twenty-five hundred years old. Which means it predates the discovery of the hyperdrive by, at minimum, five centuries. So again I ask you, where did you get these samples?" His voice is raised.`
			`	"Intriguing, isn't it?" says the archaeologist. Captain <last>, if you'd like to help us get to the bottom of this, make sure you've got space for us and some equipment, and meet us in the spaceport."`

			`You breathe a sigh of relief as you land safely in the spaceport on <planet>. "Okay, what was that all about?" you ask.`
			`	I honestly don't know," says Albert. "I can tell you what I suspect, though. The history books don't actually say when the Deep was first settled. The first documented expedition to the Deep was in the 24th century, and they found several human colonies already establised in the region, claiming to date back to the very dawn of space flight. But I think the first settlers were brought there long before that. Brought there on alien ships."`

I'm sure you know the history, how humanity was nearly enslaved by psychopathic 'super' humans that we ourselves had created by dabbling in genetic engineering. At that time, the Deep made a sudden, improbable technological leap that allowed them to construct weapons and ships far more powerful than what the Alphas had, and the war against them was won."`
