			`	He says, "You probably know that we have a network of Free Worlds sympathizers throughout much of Republic space. One of our contacts recently sent us word of a new technology that is for sale in the Deep, which could be very useful to us. But they have no way to ship it to us, so I need someone who can travel up to the Deep and retrieve it."`

			`	"You'll have to bribe some Dirt Belt worlds into letting you land, to get there," he says. "Or, you could wait for the next time there's a ceasefire. But here's the great part: if this works, you won't need to pay any bribes on the way back, because the new technology we're after is a super efficient ramscoop. What do you say?"`

That seems unnecessary to you, but perhaps he is just really enjoying the thrill of being involved in something illegal. He hands you a data card and says, "This contains all the information you will need to build your own catalytic ramscoop. And before you leave, you may aso visit our private outfitter and purchase one of your own, if you wish."`
