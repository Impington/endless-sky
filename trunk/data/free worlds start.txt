			`The mood in the spaceport is solemn. No one has had time yet to count up the losses, on both sides of the battle, but it is likely that over a thousand lives were lost. And because the Navy is held in such high regard even here where Parliament and the Paradise Planets are viewed with disgust, many of the militia captains are almost as saddened by the loss of Navy lives as by the loss of some of their own.`
			`	You find Tomek walking among the fleet, conversing with captains and assessing the damage they have suffered. When he sees you he says, "Captain <last>! How is your "<ship>" holding together?"`

				`	"She took a bit of a pounding, but I've patched her up."`
				`	"Just fine. It'd take more than a few cruisers to destroy the <ship>."`
			
			`	"Glad to hear it," he says. "Listen, we need to press our advantage before the Republic has time to call for reinforcements. If we strike quickly, we could be able to retake Kornephoros from them. It's important to break the blockade on that system just for the sake of trade with the rest of the galaxy, and on top of that, of course, Katya needs to be rescued."`
			`	"Indeed," you say.
			`	"We have a large fleet of reinforcements coming in from the Rim," he continues, "And a few ships here that are able to fight another battle. I need you to take off with them, wait for the reinforcements to arrive, and then retake Kornephoros. If the Navy ships retreat, let them retreat. If they surrender, let them surrender. But if they stay and fight, destroy them. Understood?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, sir."`
					accept
				`	"I wish it hadn't come to this."`
			
			`	"We all do," he says. "No one wanted this. Not us, certainly not the Navy. But if they attack us to take our freedom, we must defend ourselves in order to keep it. Understood?"`
			`	"Yes, sir," you say. "I'll prepare my ship for another battle."`

			`The last of the Navy vessels in orbit has been destroyed. As you land, you find that several Free Worlds troop transports have already set down in the spaceport and coralled the remaining Navy officers into a small circle. You would estimate that there are several hundred Navy prisoners. Another transport lands, carrying more prisoners: the Navy troops who had been guarding the mines on Clink.`
			`	For several hours, nothing changes: the Navy troops are huddled into a small circle, surrounded by guards. When lunchtime comes, some of the guards go to the market and fetch some of the vendors who sell meals out of carts there; they return with the carts and hand out food to the prisoners. Then, another transport lands and Tomek steps out.`
			`	He pulls you aside and asks you, "How are things going here?"`

			`	Tomek climbs up onto the hull of a nearby ship and addresses the prisoners. "Hello," he says. A few of the Navy officers respond, warily. "My name is Tomek Voigt," he says. "Our militia is very loosely organized, but I'm the one in charge of organizing it." That gets a few laughs from the Free Worlds guards. "As such, I am resonsible for deciding your fate."`
			`	At that, a hush falls over the crowd. "The council has decided," he continues, "that any of you who gives us your parole, swearing to take no further part in fighting the Free Worlds, will be returned to Republic space. You will give us your word of honor that you will either seek reassignment in another part of the galaxy, or resign your commission."`
			`	A few of the Free Worlds guards shout, "What?" But only a surprising few. The rest are nodding, seemingly pleased with the council's choice. Tomek climbs down from the hull and approaches the prisoners, and you notice Alondo and Freya have joined him.`
			`	One of the Navy officers stands up. "I'll take that oath," he says, "if you'll honor your part of it."`
			`	Tomek takes the man's hands, looks him in the eyes, and asks, "Do you swear before God and these witnesses to take no further part in military actions against the Free Worlds?"`
			`	"I do," says the officer. Several of the other prisoners stand up, and before long all but a handful have sworn the oath.`
			`	After they finish, Tomek turns to you and a few other captains. "Marco, <first>, Sarah, please meet me in the spaceport cafe when you are ready." He walks off.`
