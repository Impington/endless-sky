			`The mood in the spaceport is solemn. No one has had time yet to count up the losses, on both sides of the battle, but it is likely that over a thousand lives were lost. And because the Navy is held in such high regard even here where Parliament and the Paradise Planets are viewed with disgust, many of the militia captains are almost as saddened by the loss of Navy lives as by the loss of some of their own.`

If we strike quickly, we could be able to retake Kornephoros from them. It's important to break the blockade on that system just for the sake of trade with the rest of the galaxy, and on top of that, of course, Katya needs to be rescued."`
			`	"Indeed," you say.
			`	"We have a large fleet of reinforcements coming in from the Rim," he continues, "And a few ships here that are able to fight another battle. I need you to take off with them, wait for the reinforcements to arrive, and then retake Kornephoros. If the Navy ships retreat, let them retreat. If they surrender, let them surrender. But if they stay and fight, destroy them. Understood?"`

You would estimate that there are several hundred Navy prisoners. Another transport lands, carrying more prisoners: the Navy troops who had been guarding the mines on Clink.`
			`	For several hours, nothing changes: the Navy troops are huddled into a small circle, surrounded by guards. When lunchtime comes, some of the guards go to the market and fetch some of the vendors who sell meals out of carts there; they return with the carts and hand out food to the prisoners.

"Our militia is very loosely organized, but I'm the one in charge of organizing it." That gets a few laughs from the Free Worlds guards. "As such, I am responsible for deciding your fate."`
			`	At that, a hush falls over the crowd. "The council has decided," he continues, "that any of you who gives us your parole, swearing to take no further part in fighting the Free Worlds, will be returned to Republic space. You will give us your word of honor that you will either seek reassignment in another part of the galaxy, or resign your commission."`
			`	A few of the Free Worlds guards shout, "What?" But only a surprising few. The rest are nodding, seemingly pleased with the council's choice. Tomek climbs down from the hull and approaches the prisoners, and you notice Alondo and Freya have joined him.`
			`	One of the Navy officers stands up. "I'll take that oath," he says, "if you'll honor your part of it."`
			`	Tomek takes the man's hands, looks him in the eyes, and asks, "Do you swear before God and these witnesses to take no further part in military actions against the Free Worlds?"`
			`	"I do," says the officer. Several of the other prisoners stand up, and before long all but a handful have sworn the oath.`
			`	After they finish, Tomek turns to you and a few other captains. "Emily, Marco, <first>, Sarah, please meet me in the spaceport cafe when you are ready." He walks off.`

			`One of the first people to step off the Terebinth when it lands is Alondo, the Free Worlds diplomat. You ask him what the plan is, now.`
			`	"Well," he says, "The people I'll be meeting with here are tribal elders, of a sort. But the tribes are separated not so much by ethnicity, as by geography and ideology. I can't claim to understand all the intricacies, really, but in matters affecting the entire planet they have authority to make consensus decisions. Of course, there are hundreds of independent settlements and groups that may or may not abide by that decision."`

			`	Before he has a chance to respond, the sky lights up with incoming particle beams, and you see one of the Terebinth's engines erupt in a gout of flames. "What the hell?" says Alondo.`
			`	The captain of the Terebinth, who is standing next to you, stares slack-jawed at his ship for a second before jumping into action. "Captain <last>," he says, "fire up your ship immediately and go after whoever is attacking us. I'll call for backup, but you will need to keep the attackers distracted until they arrive."`

			`A pall of smoke still hangs over the spaceport, and as you are coming in for a landing you fly over one landing pad where bodies draped in sheets have been laid out side by side: dozens of casualties. Several buildings are in ruins, some of them still smoldering.`
			`	Alondo has survived, fortunately. He tells you, "While the fight was goin on overhead, I met with the elders, and they agreed that now that the Free Worlds exist and opposing the pirates is a viable option, they will try to put an end to piracy in this system. But they have no interest whatsoever in joining the Free Worlds."`

			`	"You can't force people to join a democracy," he says. "Maybe some day they'll be ready, but in the meantime, any pressure we exert on them will turn them from an almost-ally into an enemy."`

			`	"Indeed," he says, "I hate to say it, but that pirate attack actually helped our case. But only time will tell what will come of this experiment of letting worlds be "independent." If more worlds start wanting total independence, rather than joining us, our future may not be sustainable."`

			`	"Well, the Terebinth is patched up, but they could use an escort back to <planet>. After that, you'll have to see what the Senate or the Council want you to do."`
