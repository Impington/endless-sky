From the fact that her questioners seemed to be growing increasingly frustrated about the Free Worlds, she knew that you were still managing to resist the Navy, but they did not share any details with her.`

			`The moment you land Katya is eager to visit the Conservatory and find Ijs. In the time that he has been here, it has grown into a small but bustling community, with crowds of students walking from building to building carrying backpacks and wrapped in thick coats. You find Ijs's office; Katya knocks and says, "Professor Springborn, are you having office hours right now?"`
			`	He recognizes her voice immediately and comes running out of the office to hug her. "Katya! You're free! Is the war over?"`

			`You skim low over the surface of <origin>, with the airlock slightly open to allow Ijs to collect atmospheric samples. He's dressed in a pressure suit, and over the suit's radio he says, "Any residue that's here will be very faint. Just a few more minutes."`
			`	Sawyer directs you to the site where the secret development took place. Nothing is left but a wide and slightly overgrown clearing. After checking your radar and seeing no incoming ships, you risk landing. Sawyer says that there were buildings here a few years ago, but now not even their foundations remain, and a sensor sweep for metallic objects turns up nothing, not even as small as a single nail.`
			`	However, Ijs points out a few subtle signs of human habitation. "A clearing like this would normally form in a fire," he says, "but notice, no fire scars on the trees on the edges of the clearing.`
			`	Raven says, "And our geophysical radar is picking up structures underground. Several deep shafts, and rock that's been stressed and fractured by a large explosion. They did a good job of hiding everything else, but if you scar a planet that badly, it doesn't go away. The stones speak."`
			`	As you continue inspecting the site, suddenly Raven's copilot shouts out the door of her gunboat at you. "Syndicate ships have entered the system! We need to get back to Earth with the evidence, quickly!"`

			`As you came fleeing out of Syndicate space with their ships in hot pursuit, you couldn't help noticing that no Republic ships moved to help you or attack your pursuers.

			`	Your pessimism turns out to be justified. The hearing begins well enough, with Sawyer's testimony and the additional evidence collected by Ijs and by Raven's team. But when the floor is opened for questions, nearly every question the members of Parliament ask seems intended not to get to the bottom of the terrorist plot, but to attack or discredit Sawyer.`
				goto why

			`	You can't help but realize how many people here represent Syndicate worlds. One of them, an older man, asks, "What possible reason would the Syndicate have to launch such an attack?"`
			`	Sawyer says, "They have complex mathematical models of the galactic economy, and those models predicted a coming recession, the worst in centuries. This war forestalled that recession. From the perspective of someone who values economic growth above all else, war was a better alternative than recession."`
			`	"That's utter nonsense," says the man. "That's the sort of absurd conspiracy theory that someone with no understanding of business would invent."`
			`	The rest of the hearing is little better, but as you are leaving one of the representatives from the Deep shakes your hand, and you feel a piece of paper being pressed into your palm. You pocket it quietly and open it once you have returned to your ship. It says, "Visit us on Valhalla."`

			`When you land on Valhalla, a man shows up at your ship and introduces himself as Edrick Flint, the governor of Valhalla. He invites all of you to join him for dinner at his home, which turns out to be an apartment on the twenty-third floor of one of the downtown skyscrapers. There, he introduces you to several other regional governors and authorities.`
			`	"You may be aware," Edrick says, "that the Deep was self-governing before the formation of the Republic. Indeed, during some of the darkest centuries of the space age, the Deep stood out as a beacon of civilization, a place where piracy was not tolerated and all travelers were safe. When we joined the Republic, we retained the authority to police our own territory, and that authority includes the right to track down fugitives who have fled beyond our usual jurisdiction."`
			choice
				`	"You're suggesting a 'police action' against the Syndicate?"`

				`	"Wait, before we talk details, are you saying that you believe Sawyer's testimony against the Syndicate?"`

			label police
			`	"We want to see justice done," says Edrick. "Our proposal is that a fleet under our jurisdiction, but joined by Free Worlds and Oathkeeper vessels, will travel into the Core and arrest at least one of the Syndicate masterminds behind the terrorist attacks. Such an action would satisfy the technical requirements of legality provided that immediately prior to the arrest, one of our courts hears Sawyer's testimony and pronounces that Syndicate individual guilty."`
			choice
				`	"'Technically legal' sounds to me like a euphemism for 'something we know full well is going to get us into trouble.'"`
				`	"How exactly is a fleet of warships going to travel through Syndicate space without a massive battle?"`
					goto travel
			
			`	Ijs laughs at that. "Relax, Captain. I've been doing 'technically legal' stuff for years. It only occasionally goes disastrously wrong. But governor, if the Syndicate sees you coming, you'll need a full-scale war fleet, not just a handful of ships."`
			label travel
			`	"That's why the fleet will be composed of ships from three different organizations," says Edrick. "You will find a reason to travel to Earth with perhaps one of your fancy new Dreadnoughts as an escort. When you arrive, there will just happen to be an Oathkeeper patrol passing through the same system. And a merchant convoy from the Deep. With its own set of escorts, of course."`
			`	"We'd need to know exactly where and on what planet our target lives, prior to entering Syndicate space," says Katya. "And, if you want to have a court trial immediately prior to the arrest, it sounds like Sawyer will need to stay here."`
			`	"Indeed," says Edrick, "but I assure you, he is safer from the Syndicate here than anywhere else in human space, your own territory included. As for locating a target, that's why the Oathkeepers have requested that you visit them on Farpoint."`
			`	The rest of the evening is a more casual time for conversation, with plenty of good food and wine. At one point, Edrick pulls you aside and says, "I've requested that you be granted access to some of the new technology that was developed here during the course of the war. In particular, please find space on your ship for a ramscoop; you will need it for your next mission. And also, here." He hands you a data card. "This is a copy of Sawyer's evidence, in case something happens here. Keep it very, very safe."`

I've never had a chance before now to thank you in person."`

			`	Raven says, "Governor Edrick mentioned a plan for tracking down the Syndicate executives who were behind the attacks in the Castor and Pollux systems."`
			`	"Indeed," says Danforth. "West of here is a region of uninhabited star systems, a sort of back entrance into Syndicate space. Few ships travel through there, because there is nowhere to refuel, but with a ramscoop or enough fuel capacity, travel is possible. One of the first inhabited worlds on the other side is the lawless world of Stormhold. There, you can surely find a contact who knows enough about the inner workings of the Syndicate to tell you the home of at least a few of our targets... for a price."

But this financial guy, Alexander Solyent... your contact says he lives on a giant yacht that sails around the ocean on Nimbus. Now, that's a much more inviting target.

			`As you approach the planet, your ships spread out and begin scanning the ocean surface for a yacht matching the description you were given. After a few tense moments of wondering if Soylent is off-world at the moment, you find the ship.`
			`	With neither deflector shields nor any weaponry that you can see, the yacht clearly poses no threat to an armed starship. The Aerie that Edrick sent launches its two fighters; when they land on the yacht's deck, armed police officers emerge. Meanwhile your fleet is ready to open fire at the first sign of resistance.`
			`	The officers soon radio you that they have found Soylent, and they bring him aboard your ship. Amid all the confusion, you notice a figure in diving gear who jumps off the rear of the yacht and disappears beneath the waves - one of Soylent's men, trying to escape. But since his leader is now in your custody, and your mission is accomplished, you see no reason to chase after him.`
			`	Now all you need to do is return to <planet> without being destroyed by Syndicate ships...`
