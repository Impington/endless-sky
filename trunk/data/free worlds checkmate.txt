And the way they're paying him is with uranium, so every nuke he gives to us means another one or two he can build for himself. Not a good situation, if you ask me, but I guess the Wolf Pack thought it was the only way to turn the tide of the war."`

			`When you land on Earth, the Big Brother flies down to the spaceport with you to see that you arrive safely, then takes off immediately. You and Alondo are escorted to the House of Parliament. As you wait to be called in to speak to Parliament, Alondo seems very nervous, pacing back and forth and fiddling with his watch every few minutes.`
			`	Finally you are invited into the Parliament chambers, and Douglas Xao, the Speaker, says, "Representatives of the Free Worlds, we are prepared to hear your demands."`
			`	Alondo says, "We're not here to make demands. We're here to work together to negotiate a peace settlement. The Free Worlds are prepared to return all our prisoners of war, to cede control of the Cebalrai and Kaus Borealis systems back to the Republic, and to promise not to expand our territory north into the so-called 'breadbasket' worlds, even if those worlds want to join us. All we ask in return is autonomy, and peace, and a return of the prisoners you have taken, including Katya Reynolds."`
			`	Xao gestures to the guards, and they escort in a third person to stand beside the two of you. It takes you a moment to realize that it's Katya, looking rather worn-out and bedraggled. She whispers to you, "So, you're using nukes now? Whose damn fool idea was that?"`

				`	"It was the only way we could resist the Navy."`
				`	"I didn't find out that's what they were doing until afterwards. I don't like it any more than you do."`

			`	Xao addresses the three of you. "We have heard your demands," he says, "and now, here is our response. Katerina Reynolds, Alondo Gruyere, and <first> <last>, you are hereby charged with treason and insurrection. Your trial will begin immediately."`
			choice
				`	"What? We were guranteed safe passage!"`
				`	"You will regret this! If you arrest us, the Free Worlds will retaliate against you."`
			`	As you try to protest, Alondo speaks up. He is not shouting, but his voice carries over the murmur of other voices. "We have a ship in orbit. If we do not return--"`
			`	Xao cuts him off. "Your ship is no threat to us. We have already verified that it carries no nuclear weapons, and this building's shielding and anti-missile systems are quite sufficient to defend against conventional weapons. And there is nothing in its cargo hold but ordinary, non-radioactive metals."`
			`	Alondo says, "That's right. Tungsten, to be exact. Aerodynamic tungsten rods, each the size of a tree trunk, with a simple guidance system on one end. Our ship is in low earth orbit, traveling at a velocity of roughly eight kilometers per second." As he speaks, the Parliament chamber gradually grows very quiet. "So we will be returning to our ship," says Alondo, "with Miss Reynolds. If the ship in orbit does not hear from me every two minutes, it will jettison its cargo, and there will be nothing left of this building but a crater." He points to the watch he is wearing, and you realize that it must be some sort of communicator.`
			`	After a brief whispered consultation with a few of the other members of Parliament, Xao says, "You will lose this war, and you will pay dearly for it. Guards, let them return to their ship." You hurry back to your ship and take off immediately, aware that as soon as you are out of range of Earth, the Navy will probably be more than willing to attack you.`

			`Tomek and Alondo meet you when you land. Tomek says, "Good work aiding in the defense. Now we need to move before the Navy has time to regroup. And the Senate has decided that you will be in charge of the fleet that makes our counterattack."`
			`	Alondo says, "They have also approved a salary increase for you, to six thousand credits per diem. I know that's probably still not enough, but we are running a bit low on cash."`
			`	"One other thing," says Tomek. "I don't know how you'll feel about this, but I received word from Solace that they have nukes for sale if you want any. I'd advise against it, but it's up to you. Also, since you will be the flagship of our assault, you should make any improvements you feel are necessary to your ship. Then meet us back here, in the spaceport. Of course, if you're ready to go immediately that's fine, too."`
