	description "The Argosy from Southbound Shipyards is very popular with merchants not because of its capacity, which is actually slightly smaller than the Syndicate Freighter, but because it can hold it own in combat even against a small pirate fleet."
	description "	The Argosy is also a very easy ship to upgrade with faster engines or more powerful weapons as needed, so many privately owned Argosies have very different capabilities than the stock model."

	description "The Bulk Freighter is the ultimate cargo ship, able to carry as much cargo as four ordinary Syndicate Freighters. It is also, however, an incredibly slow ship and difficult to maneuver, especially when loaded down with cargo. Some freight caravans use ordinary freighters instead of bulk freighters just to avoid the hassle of constantly having to wait for the Bulk Freighter to properly align itself for hyperspace travel."

As a result, the latest model of freighter is equipped only with turrets, including an anti-missile turret to prevent attackers from simply bombarding them into submission from a safe distance."

	description "The Rainmaker is a missile boat built in the Republic Navy Yard. It comes equipped with four missile launchers and enough ammunition to destroy even ships many times its size. Because of their lack of maneuverability and relatively light shielding, Rainmakers serve best as long-range attack ships, and once their missile supply is spent, they are relatively useless in combat."

	description "The Lionheart Scoutship was designed back in the days when the galaxy was more sparsely populated, and ships prospecting for habitable worlds or worlds rich in resources would often travel far away from any habitable ports where they would be able to refuel. Although the galaxy has now been much more thoroughly explored, the Scout remains a popular ship for long-distance travel."

	description "Although Betelgeuse Shipyards produces other ship models as well, the majority of their profits come from sales of the Shuttle. This versatile ship serves equally well as a passenger transport or a cargo courier. It also happens to be the cheapest ship you can buy which is capable of hyperspace travel."
	description "	Shuttles are not designed to withstand combat or any sort, but they are fast and maneuverable enough to get out of harm's way if attacked by a larger, slower ship. Although they are typically unarmed, they have enough space for one weapon, which is the origin of the popular phrase, ''as useless as a blaster cannon on a shuttlecraft.''"

	description "Classified as an interceptor rather than a fighter because it has its own hyperdrive instead of needing to be carried inside a larger ship, the Tarazed Sparrow is the smallest and cheapest combat ship available. Because of its limited cargo and passenger space, the primary way for a Sparrow pilot to pay the bills is by hunting pirates... or by becoming one. In either case, it is a perilous way to earn a living."
	description "	Insurance reports indicate that as many as two out of every three first-time ship buyers who choose to pilot a Sparrow lose their ship (and often, their life as well) within the first month of owning it."

	description "The Splinter is the largest warship produced by the Megaparsec shipyard. It is designed to be faster and more maneuverable than other ships of a similar size, in order to serve as a heavy escort ship or as part of a planetary defense and patrol fleet. Because of its intended use in merchant convoys, it also has a fair amount of cargo space."

	description "The Syndicate CT-50 Star Barge is little more than a cluster of cargo containers with an engine at one end and a cockpit on the other. It is a slow and ugly ship, but it can carry enough cargo to earn its captain a steady income even in parts of the galaxy where it is hard to find passengers to carry or courier missions."
	description "	Because they often carry valuable cargo, and because they are too slow to evade any attackers, Star Barges are a common target of pirates.
