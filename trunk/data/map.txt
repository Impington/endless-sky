planet "Ada"
	landscape "land/canyon4"
	description "Ada is the home planet of Lovelace Labs, one of the most highly respected designers of starship systems and weaponry. Ada was originally settled as a mining planet, and the mines here still produce a steady stream of metal to supply the Labs and the many other industrial companies here."
	description "	From above, the planet looks almost lifeless and barren. Most of the major cities on Ada are built into the walls of the canyons, where they are protected from the high winds and occasional dust storms that sweep across the surface."
	spaceport "The spaceport is built into the walls of a canyon which has been blasted out to create trenches that are hundreds of meters wide and deep, a network of flight lanes that are well marked out with lights and beacons. Behind the docking caves is a bustling subterranean city where bare rock and gleaming metal have been woven together in an architecture that is both functional and elegant. The lighting in the caverns varies over the course of the day to match the sunlight outside."

planet "Albatross"
	landscape "land/snow6"
	description "Albatross is a cold ocean world orbiting a small, cold sun. The continents near the equator, where it is warmer, are home to anarchist farming communes, each operating independently but trading with outsiders to gain necessary supplies. Even there, winter lasts for nearly half the year, and the growing season is short."
	description "	Because the anarchists will trade with anyone regardless of legal status or government affiliation, Albatross has become a haven for pirates, as well."
	spaceport "You are glad you put on a warm coat before leaving your ship. The wind blows in stong gusts down the streets of this small spaceport town. You pass by ranchers herding cattle, a few farmers driving old, rusted-out trucks full of produce, and a couple of shady figures huddled in an alleyway negotiating what looks like a drug deal. In the center of town is a small merchant's exchange and a couple of greasy spoon diners."
	spaceport "The sign over the spaceport bar reads, ''No Gods, No Masters.'' Below it in slightly smaller writing is another sign which reads, ''No Cybernetic Implants. No Badgers, Weasels, Or Polecats.'' You have no idea what a ''polecat'' is."

planet "Amazon"
	landscape "land/forest5"
	description "Amazon is a lush, green, tropical world, a popular tourist destination for many who live in this region of space. The indigenous forests are dense and hardy enough that growing human crops here is a constant battle, and none of the native plants or fruits are edible. Aside from tourism, most of the planet's income is from petroleum mining."
	description "	The forests are home to a stunning variety of wildlife, some of it dangerous but most of it entirely indifferent to human presence. Plant life is so abundant here that even the oceans are green rather than blue, teeming with kelp and algae."
	spaceport "The Amazon spaceport is unique, built on top of tall pillars more than fifty meters above the ground, directly above the forest canopy. The landing pads, buildings, and catwalks between them are laid out in a random branching pattern, forming a shape that from above looks almost organic. Directly over the railings, you can see brightly colored birds circling beneath your feet."

planet "Antipode"
	landscape "land/snow5"
	description "Antipode is a world of creeping glaciers and year-round snow, orbiting far enough from a dim star that even when the sun breaks through the clouds, it brings little warmth. The few settlements that exist here are built near surface deposits of rare earth metals that were discovered recently, and that are mined for use in electronics and equipment throughout this sector."
	description "	The inhabitants of Antipode are among the best downhill skiers in the galaxy, and they have made some attempts to draw off-world tourists to the ski resorts here, but the weather is so hostile that they have had very little success."
	spaceport "The spaceport consists of a single enormous warehouse. The air inside is cold, but you are glad to get out of the howling wind. In one corner is a counter advertising skiing adventures, but no one is staffing it; they must be out to lunch or taking the day off. As with many of these small spaceports, it seems that the only option for food is a pub, but the smells coming from it are enticing; for once, you may have found a spaceport bar whose chef actually knows how to cook."

planet "Bloodsea"
	landscape "land/beach5"
	description "Bloodsea is nearly uninhabited, except for a few pirate outposts. Its name comes from the planet's oceans, which are blood-red due to rhodophyte algae. Although the climate is temperate and there are many white sand beaches, no one comes here hoping to go swimming."
	description "	The pirates have no industry of their own, but instead make a living by reselling stolen cargo from raids on merchant fleets."
	spaceport "When you landed your ship near one of the larger outposts, no one even came out to greet you or to check your paperwork - not that anyone on a pirate world would care about such things. In the center of town is an open-air marketplace where large men armed with large guns stand guard over piles of crates, while others examine the wares that are for sale and haggle over prices."

planet "Bluestone"
	landscape "land/mountain2"
	description "The sunlight that filters through Bluestone's atmosphere is too dim and reddish for ordinary Earth plants to thrive. The native plants, mostly grasses and lichens, have adapted their own unique chlorophyll-like molecules in response."
	description "	Bluestone is sparsely populated. Aside from one small research villages dedicated to cultivating edible hybrid crops that can grow on similar worlds, most of the industry here is focused on drilling and refining oil to make a variety of plastics."
	spaceport "Aside from the metal roofs on a few of the largest warehouses, the spaceport buildings are constructed largely of durable plastic resin, pre-cast into interlocking beams and panels. There is a small pub in the center of the port, with its exterior walls painted a cheerful yellow. All the other buildings are the same red-brown color of the raw plastic."

planet "Bourne"
	landscape "land/city8"
	description "Bourne is a well-developed industrial world that was first settled four centuries ago. Its cities are home to some of the richest individuals in this section of the galaxy, but also home to tens of thousands of homeless people, and many others whose factory jobs are barely providing enough to make ends meet."
	description "	Outside the cities, the climate is somewhat dry, but the deep valleys and some ocean regions are suitable for farming. Very little of the planet remains that is untouched by human hands."
	spaceport "The spaceport on Bourne is a collection of granite and steel towers with platforms for ships to land. The tops of the towers are blackened by factory soot and etched by acid rain, but the granite gives them a timeless, classic look very unlike many of the ports you have visited."
	spaceport "The port authorities warned you when you landed to be careful of pickpockets, so you are guarding your wallet very closely."

planet "Buccaneer Bay"
	landscape "land/beach0"
	description "Pirates who have struck it rich dream of retiring on Buccaneer Bay. It is a warm ocean planet, with many places reminiscent of the islands in the ancient Caribbean where humanity's first pirate fleets sailed."
	description "	Many of the inhabitants are in fact not pirates, but their descendants, and these children and grand-children of anarchist outlaws have built a system of regional government that oversees hospitals, schools, and other public services, all created without funding from the Republic or taxes paid to it. The planet even sports its own shipyard, although many of the ships built here are, not surprisingly, based on designs pirated from the Syndicate and Republic shipyards."
	spaceport "This is the sort of spaceport you picture in your head when you think of pirates. Half the storefronts are bars, and rum seems to be on the menu everywhere. It is almost like the stories of ancient Earth, except that the eye patches are cybernetic implants and the peg legs are motorized prosthetics. Swarthy, dangerous-looking women glance at you as you pass by, and scantily clad men crowd around the bars, which is what you seem to remember the stories said it was like on Earth, too, although there it may have been the other way around."

planet "Burthen"
	landscape "land/fields9"
	description "Burthen is only sparsely populated; the gravity here is much higher than earth normal, and although they tend to be exceptionally strong (and short), the inhabitants also have many health issues as a result. The land is suitable for farming, although irrigation is needed in most regions, but most of the industry focuses on strip mining heavy metals from the planet's crust. Some of the excavation vehicles use here are as large, complex, and costly as a capital starship."
	spaceport "You could feel the oppressive force of this planet's gravity as soon as you landed. The spaceport is a small cluster of single-story buildings. More cargo seems to be handled by robotic vehicles than by actual human operators, but the few people walking past you are all much shorter than you are. You feel like a giant, clearly out of place."

planet "Canyon"
	landscape "land/canyon1"
	description "Canyon is a large world, with gravity near the high end of what human beings can comfortably bear. Much of its surface is sandstone, leading scientists to believe that the planet was once home to large oceans, before some cataclysmic event, perhaps a rogue star drifting through the system, caused much of the planet's water to boil away. The few settlers who live hear mostly farm the deep canyons; the mesas above are dry and almost lifeless."
	spaceport "The spaceport is a wide, flat stone field with no individual landing spots marked out; you're simply responsible for finding an unoccupied space large enough for your ship, A quarter mile away from the field is a small village with a marketplace and a pub. There are only a few starships parked here. In the village, you can recognize the locals because of their stout, muscular stature; you are taller than almost everyone here."

planet "Chiron"
	landscape "land/city9"
	description "Chiron is the only planet outside the solar system that was colonized by humanity prior to the discovery of the hyperdrive. It is now the second most populous planet in the Republic, with many sprawling cities and a burgeoning pollution problem."
	spaceport "There are two spaceports on Chiron. The Old Port was built back when it was first settled, and was placed in a desert region, far from where people would want to live, so that they would not be as affected by the fallout from the nuclear propulsion that was used in the first, pre-hyperspace starships."
	spaceport "	The New Port, on the other hand, is in the center of New Sidney, one of Chiron's largest cities. Its soaring architecture and gleaming mirrored glass is intended to make a clear statement, that Chiron is everything Earth is not: clean, modern, prosperous."
	outfitter "Basic Weapons"

planet "Cornucopia"
	landscape "land/fields0"
	description "Cornucopia is a mostly agrarian world, and like several of its neighbors it has been inhabited since the early days of space travel, when settlers seeking to get as far as possible from old Earth and its troubles landed here. Through careful stewardship and attention to the rhythms and balances of nature, generation after generation of farmers have transformed this world into one of the most fertile in human space. The Cornucopia College of Agriculture is famous, and justly so."
	spaceport "The spaceport on Cornucopia is a set of massive hangars in the center of a wide-open plain. Before leaving your ship you had to sign several documents regarding the use and disposal of various chemicals used in ship operations, and the department of agriculture requires that any luggage you bring on or off world be submitted to a scan for biological material."
	spaceport "When you leave your hangar, you find yourself in an immense farmers' market, with hundreds of fruits and grains that you do not even know words for. The smell of this world is rich and earthy - you feel like you could almost receive all the nourishment your body needs just by breathing this air."

planet "Covert"
	landscape "land/valley1"
	description "Covert is home to a powerful mining cartel, operating outside the control of Republic law or any other external authority. It is rumored to be one of the few planets in human space where weapons-grade uranium and plutonium is mined and enriched. Any goods for sale here were most likely produced by slave labor, often by survivors of ships that have been captured by pirates. A massive pirate fleet is docked on the outskirts of the spaceport, a warning to any private pilot who might think of cheating or opposing the cartel."
	spaceport "From the moment you landed, you have been followed by a pair of security guards with earpieces and laser guns. The spaceport is one enormous building, with square, straight hallways and featureless walls, and nearly every door you pass is locked. Cameras at each hallway intersection pivot to watch as you approach. This is simultaneously one of the most secure spaceports you have visited, and one of the most dangerous, although if you do not do anything to provoke the animosity of the cartel, you will probably be able to leave in peace."

planet "Crossroads"
	landscape "land/valley1"
	description "Crossroads is a hot, dusty planet, where the Syndicate operates strip mines for extracting uranium ore. The plants that grow here have blue and purple leaves, very different from what your human eyes expect. They say that sandstorms were frequent here even before the Syndicate arrived, but the storms have gotten far worse in recent years, with some storms now reaching several kilometers high and dozens of kilometers in diameter."
	spaceport "The spaceport is marked out with radio beacons to allow ships to land or take off even if the air is too dusty to see the ground. The dusty air tastes metallic on your tongue. It is laced with radioactive elements, and you try your best not to breathe in too much of the dust while making your way from your ship to the low stone buildings of the port."

planet "Darkstone"
	landscape "land/hills3"
	description "Darkstone is a rainy, mountainous planet. The major continents are spidered with rivers and green valleys. A few enterprising settlers have build farming communities here, but the population remains low because of the threat of piracy from neighboring systems."
	spaceport "Once every few months, one pirate band or another will land here demanding tribute in the form of food. The locals respond by just keeping a big enough supply on hand to satisfy them; any sort of planetary defenses would cost far more than the price of the amount of food that an average fleet of warships can carry. But once they recognize that you are here to trade and not to steal, they greet you quite enthusiastically."

planet "Deadman's Cove"
	landscape "land/sea1"
	description "Deadman's Cove is an ocean planet; the continents take up only a fifth of its land mass. Legends tell of massive sea creatures hiding in the deeps: serpents hundreds of meters long; colossal sea turtles; strange tentacled monsters and exotic fish."
	description "	One island archipelago is home to the spaceport, the only part of the planet where it is safe to land uninvited. The other islands - even some that seem from a distance to be uninhabited - are often used as staging bases for pirate fleets, who guard their secrets closely."
	spaceport "Your ship is on a landing pad only a few meters above the pounding surf, and you can't help worrying about what might happen if the tide rises any higher. If nothing else, the salt water is bound to corrode your hull if you stay here too long. You make your way to a bar where a cage hanging from the ceiling holds an actual parrot. After trying for a while to get it to talk to you, you realize that it is dead, stuffed and nailed to its perch."

planet "Deep"
	landscape "land/sea3"
	description "Deep is a sparsely populated world of small island archipelagos surrounded by vast expanses of empty ocean. There is not enough land for any large cities or serious industry to emerge, so most of the inhabitants live in small fishing villages. The climate is temperate and Earth-like, but the sunlight is somewhat dimmer than you are used to."
	spaceport "The spaceport is built on a large island, a now-extinct volcano with an elevation of several kilometers at its center. Most of the large-scale fishing here is done by a single company, Poseidon Industries, who also built and maintain the spaceport. Steep winding roads and sturdy cement homes and warehouses line the mountain slopes, and below you in the harbor several massive trawling vessels are moored. On the outskirts of the spaceport are the ramshackle hoses and open-air marketplace used by the smaller, independent fishing families." 

planet "Delve"
	landscape "land/valley9"
	description "Delve is a world of towering mountains and valleys so steep that some slopes never see the light of the sun, where snow and ice remain on the topmost peaks year-round. The Syndicate's mining operations here are among the most extensive in the region, with some shafts descending several kilometers below the surface. Some of the mines are as large as a city, and in fact many of the mining cities are under ground, built in sections of old mines that have long since run out of useful metals. With all the mines and underground cities reliant on mechanical ventilation from the surface, the miners live in constant fear of two things: cave-ins, and power failures."
	spaceport "The spaceport is an enormous hollow carved out of the side of a mountain, with a network of steel beams and mesh holding the rock in place. Inside the hollow, the landings are caves carved into the rock itself, again with steel beams above to protect the ships within. A tiered set of cog railways transport passengers and cargo between the landings and the large town at the base of the hollow. Beyond the hollow, the mountainside falls off into a steep cliff and a mist-filled valley below. Although the port is well-built and modern, you cannot help an irrational fear that the whole place will slide off the edge of the mountain one day."

planet "Dune"
	landscape "land/dune2"
	description "Dune is a mostly desert world, which was uninhabited until very recently when geologists discovered that the bedrock under the desert is home to many rare mineral deposits and gemstones. Most of the inhabitants live deep underground to avoid the hot sunlight and frequent sandstorms. It is a dangerous life; cave-ins are common in the mines, and the sand on the surface can shift so suddenly that it is not uncommon for one of the underground villages to find its surface entrance buried, and to need to call for help from another village. But the mines operate with a joint ownership model where all the workers profit equally, so working here pays well. Many of the miners stay here only for five or ten years, while sending money back to their families off-world."
	spaceport "The spaceport is an enormous concrete tower rising a hundred meters above the sand, with the intention that it should be high enough to avoid being buried in even the largest of sandstorms. Each pad has landing clamps to secure your ship in case of high winds. Even so, you are a bit nervous as you leave your ship behind and board one of the cargo elevators to the complex below."
	spaceport "	There are no windows inside the port, but the tall ceilings and bright strips of sun-lights keep it from feeling too claustrophobic."

planet "Earth"
	landscape "land/city3"
	description "The ancestral home world of humanity, Earth has a population ten times that of any other inhabited planet. Sprawling cities cover large portions of its surface, many of them overcrowded and dangerous. Some people work to scrape together enough money to leave, while at the same time others, born on distant worlds, make a pilgrimage of sort to see this planet that once cradled the entirety of the human species."
	description "	Earth is also the capital of the Republic. Representative government becomes complicated when one planet has a greater population than a hundred planets elsewhere. As a result, settlements of less than a million are grouped together into planetary districts that elect a single Senator between them - a source of much frustration in the frontier worlds."
	spaceport "Earth's spaceport is a series of massive buildings; the gaps between them form narrow concrete canyons a hundred stories deep. From a distance it has the appearance of a bustling termite mound."
	spaceport "	Inside the towers is a warren of dim hallways and dingy shops. Hitchhikers sleep in the corners of unused docking bays under old army blankets, a few uniformed cleaners try to keep the litter and dust in check, and rich tourists from other stars cling tightly to their expensive cameras."
	outfitter "Basic Weapons"

planet "Farpoint"
	landscape "land/desert4"
	description "Farpoint, on the northernmost end of human space, is a rocky desert planet home to a Republic Navy base and not much else. Farming is possible only within greenhouses, and this system is too far from the galactic center to be desirable for trade or industry."
	spaceport "The spaceport is the Navy base; there are no other settlements. There are a few pubs filled mostly with off-duty officers, and a quartermaster's warehouse where you can trade goods. The most striking aspect of the base, however, is how empty it is. There are enough buildings here to make it feel like a small city, but only one small corner of the port is in use; the rest of the buildings are boarded up. And there are enough landing pads and hangars to house perhaps a fifth of the entire fleet, but they are nearly all empty at the moment."

planet "Farseer"
	landscape "land/sea8"
	description "With enough money, you can buy a sunny day. Farseer is an ocean resort world, where much of the local government's tax revenue is spent on the terraforming equipment that moderates the weather. Industry here mostly takes the form of executive offices for interplanetary banks, law firms, and software companies. Strict zoning laws limit construction of skyscrapers or factories to the continents that are in the less pleasant polar regions."
	spaceport "The spaceport is in one of the industrial regions near the pole; presumably the sight and sound of starships landing and taking off is too distasteful and bourgeois for this world's richer inhabitants. Most of the people here are terraforming technicians or mechanics; they hurry through the streets without giving you a second glance. Next to the tin-roofed marketplace, children are playing in a concrete-paved lot; across the street are a few run-down pubs and a restaurant."

planet "Featherweight"
	landscape "land/sky6"
	description "Featherweight is a small world, with lighter than normal gravity. Centuries ago, because of its remoteness, this world was the site of some illegal genetic experiments, and rumors say that the current inhabitants are the result of those experiments. Because they are so well adapted to low gravity, few of them choose to leave, and very few outsiders choose to settle here, so this world's culture remains quite insular and detached from the rest of the galaxy."
	spaceport "Although this is a human planet, as you walk through this spaceport you feel as if you are on an alien world. The ceilings and doorways are all a bit higher than you are used to, and the locals tower over you. Aside from a few food carts in the marketplace, there are no shops or restaurants in the spaceport, and the nearest village is several kilometers away. It is as if the entire port was designed in order to limit interactions with outsiders to the bare minimum that is necessary."

planet "Flood"
	landscape "land/water8"
	description "The scenic fjords and rugged mountains make Flood a popular tourist destination. Nearly all the land in the planet's temperate zone is covered in mountains, making traditional agriculture difficult. The locals survive mostly by raising sheep and goats, plus a few native species, and grow fruit and vegetables in small terrace gardens tended by hand rather than by tractor. Most of the population is employed in the tourist industry, running inns for the visitors to their quaint mountainside villages, or making hand-made crafts for sale as gifts."
	spaceport "You have never seen this many shops in a single spaceport. Hand-glazed pottery, wooden furniture, dolls, sweaters, scarves, paintings - the variety is overwhelming. Crowds of tourists bustle around from shop to shop, making it very difficult for you to get through."
	spaceport "	The spaceport is built on a mountainside, apparently designed to look like a village, except that in place of terrace gardens are landing pads (placed haphazardly to look more natural), and the buildings are much larger than you imagine the huts up in the villages would be. The cement tiles covering the roofs have been molded and colored to look like wood shingles, and although some of the larger buildings must have steel structures underneath, they have been made to look as if they are held up only by wooden beams."

planet "Forpelog"
	landscape "land/badlands4"
	description "Forpelog is a Quarg mining world, barely habitable by their standards and, because of its low gravity, unsuitable for long-term human habitation. The Quarg city is a marvel of advanced technology, entirely enclosed within glass and steel, with gardens and terraces where alien trees and plants grow. Outside the city, the landscape is rugged and beautiful, for the atmosphere is too thin to breathe and contains almost no oxygen."
	spaceport "Your ship is docked on a metal pad immediately outside the dome of the city, which towers over you. Immediately after you landed, a smaller canopy unfolded around your ship, sealing it in and providing enough air for you to breathe as you make your way inside. The stark, lifeless badlands outside give way to bustling streets and lush blue foliage within. No other human beings are in sight."

planet "Foundry"
	landscape "land/city1"
	description "Foundry is home to the Syndicated Shipyards, where more than half of the commercial freighters in human space are manufactured. Although much of the planet is blanketed in smog from the factories, there are also regions of pristine forests and majestic mountains. The Syndicate has a generous vacation policy on Foundry that allows workers to take as much as a month of vacation time every year, and many choose to take that time to escape from the cities and explore the wilderness. The shypyards claim that this vacation time is partly responsible for the high reliability of the ships built here, because a well-rested and relaxed worker is less likely to make the sort of mistakes that can quickly become disastrous in outer space."
	spaceport "The spaceport is surrounded by miles of hangars and factories where new ships are being assembled. The port itself is a trio of towering buildings, with a skywalk on the top floors to provide a view of the surrounding area. Larger ships land on pads on the ground surroundign the towers, while smaller ships can fly into hangars built into the sides of the towers themselves. Everything is made of gleaming metal, and each tower is slightly tapered and adorned with painted fins that make it resemble an enormous starship."

planet "Freedom"
	landscape "land/desert2"
	description "Freedom is home to the oldest and largest anarchist colonies in human history. The original settlers arrived in the first century after the discovery of spaceflight, coming with the goal of simply getting as far away from civilization as possible. The colony has reinvented itself countless times since then as different leaders have taken control, and in fact at present it is split into two separate towns, East Mesa and West Mesa."
	description "	The environment is a mix of deserts and brackish oceans, with a fair amount of native wildlife and good potential for farming. Anywhere else in human space, this planet would have become densely settled, but out here it has remained mostly empty."
	spaceport "Apparently anarchists are not opposed to commerce as long as no one is regulating it. Half of the landing pads in the spaceport are available for ships; the other half have been taken over by farmers busy selling their produce, or merchants buying from incoming ships and piling crates into large trucks."
	spaceport "	A sign above the entrance to the spaceport bar reads, ''Fine home-brewed whiskey! Get smashed without getting taxed!'' Further down the street, a sign over what appears to be a real estate office reads, ''Why not settle where The Man can't reach you?''
	spaceport "	Inexplicably, the only advertising on the seafood restaurant across the street is an enormous banner proclaiming, ''We have brown rice.''"

planet "Furnace"
	landscape "land/canyon3"
	description "Furnace is a nearly uninhabited world, used mostly as a waypoint for shipping and as a staging point for the Syndicate fleets that seek to keep this region of space free from pirates. The atmosphere is barely thick enough to be breathable, and none of the plants that grow here are useful for eating, but because it is only a large moon instead of a full-sized planet, moving cargo and fleets of ships to and from its surface is fairly easy and inexpensive."
	spaceport "The spaceport is mostly a military base. Uniformed crew members hurry back and forth without giving you a second glance. The food in the mess hall is standard military fare, hearty but bland and unappetizing, and there are few shops or other services catering to civilians."

planet "Geminus"
	landscape "land/fog5"
	description "Geminus, although not the most hospitable of planets, is a young enough planet that large stores of iron, titanium, and other metals are easily accessible near the surface. For that reason, it has become one of the Republic's primary shipyards. More than half of the warships in the navy were constructed here."
	spaceport "Like everything else on Geminus, the spaceport is not terribly pretty, but is functional and efficient. Each of the wide hallways is marked out like a road, with space in the center for electric carts carrying cargo, while pedestrians are relegated to the edges."
	spaceport "	The hub of the spaceport is a food court with a ring of shops in the center and seating on the outside, where you can look out of plate glass windows at the lava fields and caldera outside. By night, you can see the volcanic glow all around the horizon."
	shipyard "Basic Ships"
	outfitter "Basic Weapons"

planet "Glaze"
	landscape "land/canyon8"
	description "Glaze is a varied world with everything from sunny beaches to frozen tundra, but it is perhaps best known for its sandstone canyons and deserts. This world's wildlife has never been studied in great detail. Local rumors tell about an alien species of ''canyon people'' who live in caves in some of the deepest canyons, leading to a constant stream of visiting xenobiologists. The scientific consensus, however, is that these sightings have only been of a reclusive ape-like species that lives in the canyons, and is not known to dig caves or show any other sign of civilization."
	spaceport "The spaceport is a tower of glass and steel perched on top of a mesa, overlooking the canyonlands: spires of red and pale yellow stone, with a sprinkling of trees at the lower elevations. A wide highway winds down the side of the mesa, through several tunnels, and the off to the horizon. The port itself is not terribly busy."
	spaceport "	You notice quite a few families with children sitting by the windows on the upper stories of the tower, watching starships landing and taking off. Many of them have brought folding chairs or blankets to sit on. That must be what passes for entertainment on this world."

planet "Glory"
	landscape "land/sky8"
	description "Elsewhere in the galaxy, people speak dismissively of the ''boughten sunshine'' that rich, terraformed worlds can afford. On Glory, even many of the lakes and hills are artificial, crafted to garden-like perfection. Fittingly, the chief industry on Glory is plastic surgery, along with other medical efforts aimed at prolonging life, funded by rich, elderly folks who have settled here."
	spaceport "The starport is as perfectly sculpted as the rest of the planet, a hive-like structure with hexagonal openings of various sizes for docking bays. Gardens have been planted on the roofs and on terraces on all different levels, and a small artificial river flows from a fountain on the roof down among the terraces and out to the ground below."
	spaceport "	It is almost impossible to tell the age of the locals who are walking by: there is a frightening monotony of wrinkle-free, nearly identically proportioned faces. When they speak, only their lips move; their expressions remain mask-like, immobile."

planet "Grakhord"
	landscape "land/water9"
	description "Although human beings who do not mind living in low gravity are welcome to settle here, Grakhord is part of Quarg territory, and has been terraformed to meet their environmental needs rather than those of human beings. The full extent of the Quarg mining operations here are not known, but rumors say that they have tunnels reaching down almost halfway to the moon's core, and Quarg ships can also sometimes be seen harvesting hydrogen gas from the upper atmosphere of the gas giant that Grakhord orbits."
	spaceport "Here, you feel like a young child lost among a crowd of tall, indifferent adults. The average adult Quarg is over three meters tall, and although they move slowly and gracefully, on their long legs they easily speed by you. Worse, the counters for the merchant exchange, bank, and job board are high enough that you can barely see over them. But, the Quargs have helpfully provided stepping stools stashed under the counters so that shorter humans can carry out business without having to constantly crane their necks upwards."

planet "Greenrock"
	landscape "land/sky0"
	description "Greenrock is the closest thing that the pirates in southern human space have to a center of government, but taking the form of large, powerful corporations rather than elected officials. When rival pirate bands seek to negotiate on neutral territory, this is where they meet. Nearly everything is for sale here: illegal weapons, ships customized for pirating, and even slaves."
	spaceport "You have heard enough about this port's reputation that you are not surprised to see the slave markets, heavily guarded in case any visitors happen to find themselves in possession of a conscience. Nor are you shocked by the shady establishments catering to all manner of prurient interests. This is, after all, a pirate port, and everything is for sale here."
	spaceport "Everything, in fact, including the very bizarre. At the end of one dark alley you see a shop called ''Mike's Mustelids,'' with weasels and ferrets in cages in the window. Beside them, a fully-grown wolverine glares at you from behind the bars of a large and sturdy cage."

planet "Haven"
	landscape "land/dune1"
	description "Haven was founded by a highly successful ''privateers'' nearly two centuries ago. Since then, as rival bands of pirates have fought over it, it has changed hands fourteen times, but has never been successfully invaded by the Republic. Numerous small manufacturing shops sell outfits that cannot be bought legally, and there is even a small shipyard where customized ships are sold."
	description "	Much of the planet is desert, but with enough moisture to grow enough crops to feed the entire population. Strip mining has turned other parts of the planet into barren wastelands, and has polluted many of the rivers."
	spaceport "The spaceport is old and dingy, with piles of litter in the gutters and graffiti on many of the alley walls. Many of the shops are closed, the windows boarded over or covered with yellowing paper. This is an independent world, and a relatively stable settlement, but the effects of its separation from the rest of the galaxy are evident. A few young people carrying large backpacks eye you with interest, perhaps trying to gauge their chances of getting you to give them a cheap lift off-planet."

planet "Hephaestus"
	landscape "land/city0"
	description "Hephaestus is home to Syndicated Systems, which manufactures parts used in shipyards throughout human space. Although not always the highest quality or most technologically advanced, ship outfits produced by the Syndicate are quite affordable and sufficient for any ordinary pilot's needs. The executives of many other companies have been known to make a pilgrimage of sorts to this planet, to witness firsthand how the Syndicate has made their production lines here so efficient and dependable."
	description "	Nearly all the inhabitants of Hephaestus live in a single metropolitan area that has spread to cover almost an eigth of the total land mass. As with many Syndicate worlds, pollution is a growing problem that they are working hard to address."
	spaceport "The spaceport consists of a double row of hangars of all different sizes, with shops and warehouse space in between.In many of the hangars you pass by, mechanics are busy installing new parts or making repairs to old ones. The flash of arc welders and the squeal of bolt drivers and rivet guns is everywhere. Above the hangars is a tier of supply rooms with all different sorts of ship outfits on display, rows and rows of gleaming, identical parts. Robotic gantries swing overhead at frightening speeds, stocking and fetching parts. It serves as both a functional storage space and a massive advertisement for the Syndicated equipment."

planet "Hermes"
	landscape "land/sky7"
	description "No one is permitted to settle on Hermes without a government permit. It is a sparsely populated world, mostly used for medical research and development - including some research that, if the rumors are true, are carried out here in isolation so that if something goes wrong, entire districts can be quarantined or even ''sterilized'' by orbital bombardment."
	description "	The landscape is nondescript, mostly rolling plains and forests. The oceans are relatively small, and and a result it is a somewhat dry planet."
	spaceport "The spaceport is far removed from any of this world's cities. It consists of a single, ring-shaped building; the docking bays open onto the central atrium, which visiting ships fly through to reach them. Industrial strength ultraviolet lasers are mounted on turrets throughout the atrium, and fire automatically at entering and departing ships to sterilize them. Once you land, the docking bay is hermetically sealed. Based on the precautions they are taking, you find yourself wanting to spend as little time as possible breathing the air here."

planet "Hestia"
	landscape "land/sky5"
	description "In the distant past, Hestia was a nearly lifeless ice world. It is now a sub-tropical paradise, one of the great victories from the heyday of planetary engineering back when the galactic economy had more money to spare for terraforming. Today it is mostly a retirement community for those who can afford it, although most of the population consists of young service workers in rented housing who take care of the retirees. On Hestia, the poor live in cities; the rich live in country estates. Aside from the urban centers, most of this world is covered in rolling green hills and oceans."
	spaceport "Hestia has two separate spaceports. The port where rich residents and their visitors arrive and depart is private, owned by a local company. Here in the public spaceport, no attempt has been made at impressive architecture: everything is spare and utilitarian, with floors of bare cement. There are a few trucks and forklifts carrying cargo, but the streets that connect the landing pads are mostly full of people on foot, walking toward the customs building."

planet "Hippocrates"
	landscape "land/water6"
	description "Hippocrates is a sparsely settled world, home mostly to scientific research outposts. The environment here, orbiting so close to a red dwarf star, is very different from most other settled planets. The scientists estimate this star system to be over ten billion years old, enough that life here has had much more time to develop and evolve than on any planet orbiting a brighter, more short-lived star."
	spaceport "The spaceport is a single building, and half the landing pads are just packed dirt. This port was not designed for large volumes of cargo or of visitors. Within the building is a sun-lit atrium, with separate storefronts for the commodity exchange, the job center, and the bank. The only place you can see where you might be able to get something to eat is a bar, advertised by a sign showing an Erlenmeyer flask with a folding paper umbrella hung over the rim."

planet "Humanika"
	landscape "land/beach2"
	description "The gravity is too strong on this planet for the Quarg to inhabit it, so they have welcomed human settlers instead. Many people who want freedom from the dangers of human space and the endless instability of human government have settled here. Although the regions near the equator are far too warm to be comfortable, the climate closer to the poles is almost ideal; the only reason Humanika is not as densely populated as some of the worlds farther to the galactic north is the distrust with which most humans view the Quarg."
	spaceport "The spaceport is a towering steel structure, built by the Quarg, with docks for their pilot-less cargo drones in addition to the platforms for human ships. The hallways inside have disconcertin proportions, somewhat narrow but with very tall ceilings. In addition to the human inhabitants, there are a few tall, almost fragile-looking robots with digitigrade limbs and narrow torsos patterned after the anatomy of a Quarg. Most of the robots stand still in the corners, like statues, but a few are moving around and interacting with people, apparently as remote control proxies for Quargs in orbit. It is a clear reminder of who owns this planet."

planet "Icefall"
	landscape "land/snow4"
	description "Icefall is a cold world, but with an axial tilt of roughly 38 degrees, enough that each hemisphere has a short growing season. There are only a few major towns, and no major metropolitan centers. Most of the inhabitants make a living as farmers, although near the equator there is also some oil drilling industry. Icefall's oceans are filled with constantly shifting pack ice and icebergs, making them nearly unnavigable."
	spaceport "The spaceport is located near the equator, in this world's industrial zone. Along the horizon are fields of pumpjacks and oil derricks. The port consists of rows of hangars, plus two large square towers that house the marketplace and storage space for cargo. A constant howling wind sweeps in between the buildings, but thankfully they are well constructed out of sturdy cement."

planet "Lagrange"
	landscape "land/sky2"
	description "The Quarg built this station centuries ago, before they began construction on the ringworld. From the dark side of the station, the ring is visible as a thin bright filament stretching out to either side of the system's sun. The ring itself is closed to human visitors, but tour shuttles depart from here on a regular basis, giving human tourists a closer view at this engineering feat that is so far beyond what anything human beings have ever attempted to build."
	spaceport "In the docking section are flexible, oddly organic-looking tubes that snaked out to connect to your ship as it approached. Walking through the tube and into the station is a somewhat disconcerting experience. Inside, crowds of human tourists gawk at the tall, thin Quargs, who for the most part seem unfazed by the attention. The station is perfectly clean; every surface shines."

planet "Lichen"
	landscape "land/fields3"
	description "Lichen is a rainy world of marshes, fields, and streams. More than half the rice consumed in this administrative district is grown on Lichen, because of its near-optimal climate. However, because of the constant rain and overcast weather, few people aside from farmers have settled here."
	spaceport "The spaceport is built on a small mountain, one of the rare places where enough bedrock rises above the soil to provide a firm foundation for large buildings and a flood-free location. The warehouses and market are built of concrete, but the smaller buildings on the outskirts of the port are wood framed. Moss is growing everywhere, and in places the wood is stippled with mold. But the people are friendly enough, unhurried and peaceful."
	spaceport "A noodle soup restaurant near the center of the port town seems to be the gathering place of choice. Whatever they're cooking inside, it smells delicious."

planet "Lodestone"
	landscape "land/lava5"
	description "Lodestone is a young, volcanically active world. The atmosphere is often filled with choking dust or sulfur dioxide, and new eruptions can occur with hardly any warning. Building any sort of structure here is an exercise in futility."
	description "The only reason Lodestone is inhabited is because of the planet's unusually rich reserves of heavy metals and other rare minerals."
	spaceport "This port is known as ''Fourth Port.'' The previous three ports are partly or completely buried under lava flows. The present port is built on a raised platform a hundred meters above the ground. The steel stilts supporting the platform are intended to keep the port from being buried by any encroaching lava flow. However, given that some explosive eruptions here have been known to launch lava nearly a kilometer into the air, sooner or later Fourth Port will need to be replaced by a fifth."

planet "Longjump"
	landscape "land/city9"
	description "Longjump is a mostly industrial world, with lower than normal gravity that makes it relatively easy to operate and transport heavy equipment. Hang-gliding is also a popular sport here, although for safety reasons they are not allowed anywhere near the spaceport."
	spaceport "You can recognize the natives immediately because they are almost all taller than you, a result of growning up in a low-gravity environment. The spaceport consists of four large towers, connected by bridges, with openings for hangars in the sides. The upper stories are for landing ships; business takes place down below, at street level."

planet "Luna"
	landscape "land/earthrise"
	description "In the early days of space travel, back when engines were still so inefficient that escaping from a planet's gravity was costly and difficult, an enormous shipyard was built on the Moon where asteroids, harvested from the asteroid belt, were mined for raw materials for ships."
	description "	The facility is still in operation, although it is now overshadowed by the far more advanced shipbuilding centers like Geminus in the Castor system."
	shipyard "Basic Ships"

planet "Maelstrom"
	landscape "land/rock0"
	description "Maelstrom is a stormy, geologically young world with towering mountains and frequent earthquakes. Most of the large cities are near the center of the planet's largest continent, where the iron beds from an ancient ocean are exposed. Maelstrom is one of the chief exporters of iron, copper, gold, titanium, and other metals to Ada, where Lovelace Labs and the associated industries have a continuous need for raw materials."
	spaceport "The spaceport is a single massive complex of buildings, with hangars large enough for even a dreadnought or a carrier. A railroad runs through several of the nearby mining towns and straight into the spaceport building itself, allowing ore and processed metal to be loaded directly from the mine cars into the waiting freighters."

planet "Mainsail"
	landscape "land/beach4"
	description "Mainsail is a water world: although there are some settlements on dry land, the largest cities are floating, artificial islands, which travel between hemispheres over the course of the year pursuing the most ideal weather. Other, smaller islands are privately owned by single families or corporations. Mainsail is a prohibitively expensive place to live."
	description "Centuries ago Mainsail was home to pirates of the old-fashioned variety, fleets of motor boats or even old-fashioned sailing vessels that would launch raids against the city-ships."
	spaceport "The spaceport is on its own city-ship floating some distance away from the others, so that the locals need not deal with the noise and uncouth manners of spacefarers. Surrounding the port is a ring of docks where barges are moored; on platforms farther ''inland,'' starships land. Few goods are produced here; most of the people rich enough to live on Mainsail are connected with interplanetary corporations whose physical business takes place elsewhere."

planet "Maker"
	landscape "land/desert4"
	description "When families or young adults on Earth find themselves stifled by the crowded conditions on humanity's home world, Maker is where many of them end up. The Syndicate offers free transportation and housing in exchange for five years of service in the mines or factories on Maker. The living conditions are often unpleasant, with young men and women packed into dormitories, and with those who are most in need of income taking dangerous jobs in the mines. Five or ten years of work will earn you enough to set up a homestead on any of the frontier worlds, and to many, those years are worth it."
	spaceport "The spaceport on Maker is enormous, but laid out very efficiently. In one sector, a steady stream of passengers, most of them young and dressed somewhat shabbily, are disembarking. They are funneled straight to a labor and immigration center, from which they will be assigned to different factories. Meanwhile, a smaller stream of older, tired-looking but better dressed workers flows in the other direction; people who have finished their terms of service and are boarding ships for other worlds."
	spaceport "In the commercial sector of the port, robotic cargo trucks rumble through the streets at frightening speeds, while pedestrians walk from building to building along skyways several stories up."

planet "Mars"
	landscape "land/desert0"
	description "Mars was humanity's first attempt at terraforming. Although it remains a dry, cold desert, the air is now breathable without an oxygen tank, and there are sections of the planet where a fair number of plants can grow. Because far more hospitable planets are available to those with enough money to pay for interstellar travel, the farms and ranches of Mars are run mostly by poorer Earth families who want to escape the pollution and congestion, along with some young adults who do farm work to help finance their once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to stand on another world."
	spaceport "The spaceport on Mars is situated next to the northern Polar Basin, one of the few places where, post-terraforming, a natural lake exists. Here, far more trees grow than elsewhere on the planet, and in the few warm months when the lake is not frozen, Mars almost looks like a friendly place."

planet "Martini"
	landscape "land/beach1"
	description "Martini is a world of exotic beaches and perfect weather. The Republic's central bank and the galactic stock exchange are headquartered here, and so much money flows through this world's economy every day that the cost of utterly controlling its weather and climate is only a drop in the bucket. Not surprisingly, real estate prices here are astronomical; a small condo in one of Martini's main cities costs more than a capital starship."
	spaceport "The spaceport is a set of four skyscrapers joined by bridges and platforms at various levels. Hangars are built directly into the towers themselves, with deflector shield generators set up to ensure that ships do not crash, intentionally or otherwise, while approaching the towers to dock. Inside, all the floors and walls are gleaming granite, with teams of workers constantly polishing everything to ensure that not even so much as a fingerprint smudge is visible."

planet "Mere"
	landscape "land/sea7"
	description "Mere is a world almost entirely covered by oceans. The locals live most of their lives on enormous ships, almost like floating cities, which travel around collecting fish and seaweed for food or harvesting pearls from the shallows to be sold off-world. The city-ships must do their best to avoid certain latitudes where hurricanes are most common, and even so storms are a continuous threat to anyone who lives here. Weather conditions are tracked constantly by a network of satellites."
	spaceport "The spaceport is on the largest island on the planet. The marketplace is a large, open plaza down by the docks, where the captains of whichever city-ships are moored here at the moment can sell their goods directly to customers. Behind the plaza are large warehouses. If a storm approaches, the goods can quickly be moved inside, while the ships launch out into the deep sea where they have a better change of weathering the storm without being smashed against the rocks."
	spaceport "	The entire port is filled with the almost overpowering smell of fish. You have heard that this is the best place in the galaxy for good, cheap sushi, but the smell is doing nothing for your appetite."

planet "Millrace"
	landscape "land/city6"
	description "Millrace is an overpopulated world, full of factories and manufacturing plants. It is one of several planets in this region of space where people trying to escape from the crowded squalor and polluted cities of Earth come looking for work. Most of the goods manufactured here end up being used by the Syndicate for constructing starships or driving industry on other worlds."
	spaceport "The spaceport is ugly. As the population of Millrace has grown, the spaceport has been expanded to support the increase immigration; you can recognize the different sections because in the newer ones, the bare cement walls are lighter and have accumulated less soot and grime. Most of the restaurants are of the greasy spoon variety.

planet "Moonshake"
	landscape "land/city7"
	description "Moonshake is a planet of overpopulated cities side by side with dense wilderness. A few centuries ago it became a local center of industrial production when the Syndicate began building factories here. Since then, immigrants looking for steady work have been pouring in, doubling the planet's population every few decades. It is now a regional center for the production of everything from textiles to molded plastic parts to reactor-grade plutonium."
	spaceport "The smog is so thick here that you could barely see the landing pad until you were only half a kilometer above it. At street level, the smog is less evident, but the air leaves a faint metallic taste in your mouth. The spaceport, like the rest of this city, is overcrowded, with people walking along the narrow streets and trying to thread their way in between large cargo trucks loaded with crates. You see signs for restaurants of every variety imaginable, but most of them look dirty and dimly lit."

planet "Mutiny"
	landscape "land/sky6"
	description "Centuries ago, Mutiny was used as a sort of prison world for a powerful band of pirates, a place where rivals could be marooned or held for ransom, rather than killing them outright. It is a cold, dark planet, and food is scarce, but over time several villages developed in the more hospitable regions. No longer prisoners, the inhabitants who remain do so because they prefer a simple life beyond the reach of any government, on a planet that will never be stolen from them because it carries nothing of value."

planet "Nimbus"
	landscape "land/fog6"
	description "Nimbus is a stormy ocean world, where a rain shower can descend on you almost without warning, only to be replaced with equal suddenness by bright sunshine. It draws mostly the sort of people who can weather such changes with placid, unperturbed calm; tourist guidebooks often rank Nimbus near the top in their lists of ''friendliest natives.''"
	description "	All the industry on Nimbus is driven by the sea. Fish are plentiful, and the oceans here also contain some unique microorganisms that are harvested to extract useful medical compounds."
	spaceport "The spaceport is on a small island, but well above the high water mark. The mixture of ocean spray and fog and drizzling rain is enough to turn your clothes damp even just on the short walk from your landing pad to the main cluster of buildings. Thankfully, the weather is warm, but you are glad to find a cozy, dry, and welcoming space in the coffeehouse across from the warehouse district."

planet "Oasis"
	landscape "land/dune3"
	description "Although much of Oasis is desert, a few tropical regions exist that are more suited to human habitation. The settlements are small, and rely mostly on agriculture, ranching, and textiles to produce goods that can be sold off-world. For those who are drawn to simple frontier living, it is a paradise, where you can earn a living just by working with your hands, and where the only mode of transportation anyone needs is a horse."
	description "	Many outsiders, of course, view the Oasis lifestyle as backward and primitive."
	spaceport "Most cargo on Oasis is carried by horse-drawn wagons. Some of them are made of steel, but others seem to be built of hand-hewn wood. The sight of horses drawing loads onto and off of gleaming starships is almost surreal."

planet "Pilot"
	landscape "land/badlands0"
	description "Pilot is used as a research and testing station for Lovelace Labs. The research buildings are not open to non-employees. From a distance it looks almost like a small war is going on, with missiles being fired from a silo toward a hilltop where an anti-missile turret is picking them off one by one."
	description "	Rumors say that the Sidewinder Missile engineering team and the Missile Defense team are in fierce competition with each other, and whichever team is currently losing to the other must buy them lunch every Friday."

planet "Placer"
	landscape "land/mountain4"
	description "Placer is uninhabited aside from one small mining outpost; the atmosphere contains uncomfortable levels of ammonia and sulfur dioxide, and although brief exposure is not considered a health threat, those who live here must wear breathing gear when they leave their pressurized homes and mine shafts. Several scientific experiments over the last few centuries have sought to introduce microorganisms that would break down the harmful chemicals and transform the atmosphere to make it safer for human beings to breathe, but none have been successful."
	spaceport "The port consists of a large atmospheric dome, with landing pads and airlocks around the periphery. Although brief exposure to the air is not considered harmful, you find yourself holding your breath as you run from your ship to the airlock. Inside the dome, hanging gardens and open park land create a much more hospitable place, but the spaceport is nearly deserted, aside from one small pub that seems to be full of mine workers whose shift has just ended."

planet "Poisonwood"
	landscape "land/desert6"
	description "Until very recently, Poisonwood was home to a slave colony run by a powerful outlaw cartel. Tens of thousands of slaves were forced to work in hot, dirty manufacturing plants or irrigating fields out under the burning sun. Finally, in the year 2985, a Republic Navy strike force defeated the cartel and liberated the slaves. The Navy also supplied the manpower and equipment necessary to transform the factories and towns into a more livable setting for those who chose to remain, while giving others free passage off-world."
	description "	Today, most of the inhabitants are children of the liberated slaves, and like their parents they remain grateful and fiercely loyal to the Republic."
	spaceport "The starport is a hodgepodge of small metal structures, built from the remains of Navy and pirate ships that fought for control of this world. The locals are unusually courteous and proud to welcome you to their planet."
	spaceport "	The tavern in the center of the port is named The Parting Glass. The walls are covered with photographs from after the war: liberated slaves boarding Navy ships to leave this planet that had brought them so much pain; Navy officers leaving their ships to retire on this world that they liberated; friends gone away, and friends left behind. It is a strange feeling to sit here so deeply immersed in signs of a history that you had no part in."

planet "Poseidos"
	landscape "land/sea9"
	description "Poseidos is an ocean world, speckled with tiny islands. The people who live on the islands almost all make a living by fishing. The oceans are so plentiful that the locals say that only a fool or a very lazy person would starve here; there are enough fish even near shore that most families just own a small boat rather than the larger vessels designed for the deep ocean."
	description "The only scarce resource here is fresh drinking water. The village roofs are designed so that every drop of rain can be collected and conserved."
	spaceport "The spaceport is on one of the larger archipelagos. It is built half on land, and half over the water, with a series of bridges and wide canals allowing foot traffic above and cargo barges below. The bridges are built with stone arches rather than steel truss structures, partly to allow more clearance for boats below but also partly just for appearances. For a spaceport, it is an unusually beautiful place."

planet "Prime"
	landscape "land/city0"
	description "Prime is a very Earthlike ocean world, with a population of over a billion people. It is home to Betelgeuse Shipyards, and much of the industry on the planet is related to ship-building in one way or another, like refining and working metal, or developing exotic new hull and framing materials. Although some mining is done in more remote regions of the planet, Prime is reliant on shipments of metal and other goods to feed its industries."
	spaceport "The spaceport is a long, multi-story building designed to look like a carrier starship, but much larger. It is built mostly of steel and glass, with the sturdy beams and girders that support the building visible on the inside, giving it the look of a ship still in construction, whose interior has not yet been fully fitted out. In nearby hangars, final assembly is being done on ships, some of which have been completed and are now for sale."

planet "Quicksilver"
	landscape "land/mountain7"
	description "Quicksilver is a world of highly variable, violent weather: hurricanes, hail, and earth-shaking thunderstorms. Under the planet's crust, it is equally turbulent and unpredictable, leading to frequent earthquakes and volcanic activity."
	description "	Although Quicksilver has vast mineral resources, the tectonic activity makes underground mining far too dangerous. However, a few enterprising settlers work in surface mining and mountaintop removal. The result are ugly, but this is a far too inhospitable world for anyone to care what it looks like."
	spaceport "The spaceport is a single, enormous hangar built as a geodesic dome. It is filled with the constant dull roar of rain beating against the dome from above. When an especially strong blast of wind strikes the dome, its joints flex slightly and you can see the whole structure ripple and move."
	spaceport "	Amenities here are minimal: a small cafeteria selling hot drinks and warm stew, and a marketplace mostly filled with stacks of refined steel and aluminum and titanium for sale. A smaller stack of lead-lined crates hold radioactive metals. The air is not particularly cold here, but it is very damp, and the howling weather outside seems to weigh on everyone's spirits."

planet "Relic"
	landscape "land/valley4"
	description "As a borderline-habitable planet in one of the systems neighboring Sol, Relic was colonized hundreds of years ago in the early years of the space race. Because of its low gravity and limited natural resources, only a few minor settlements are left."
	spaceport "The spaceport on Relic consists of one low building surrounded by open-air concrete slabs for ships to land on. If rain were more common here, you would worry about your ship rusting, but in this environment the only threat to it is the infrequent sand storms."

planet "Reunion"
	landscape "land/city5"
	description "Reunion is one of the most earth-like planets found by the early settlers, all the way down to its moon and tides. It has grown into a mostly urban world, which supplies manufactured goods of all sorts to the neighboring systems."
	spaceport "The spaceport, although designed as a clean and modern building, is a place of barely controlled chaos: vendors selling food on the sides of the hallways, tourist families with young children, and even a few farmers driving cattle. People of every age and race and occupation rub shoulders here, but there is no sign of the extreme sort of poverty that you have seen on some other worlds."
	outfitter "Basic Weapons"

planet "Rust"
	landscape "land/fields8"
	description "Rust is smaller than Earth, but very similar in climate. Much of its surface is suitable for agriculture, with wide open grasslands and dense forests. There are very few mountains, since the planet has low levels of tectonic activity."
	description "	The chief industry on Rust, however, are the factories and labs for Kraz Cybernetics, a maker of robots, computers, and advanced weapons systems. The planet's population is not large, but the schools are among the best in the region, and many of the inhabitants - even those who live on the farms - hold at least one advanced degree."
	spaceport "The spaceport is a gleaming, modern steel structure, with docks extending out from it like spokes from an axle, and magnetic clamps to hold ships of any size. As you walk into the building, you cannot help gawking. Most of the shops are staffed by robots instead of human beings, and the elevators are so smooth and silent that you can hardly tell they are moving at all. Even though you know that all this technology was provided by the marketing department of Kraz Cybernetics as a showcase of their capabilities, you cannot help but be inspired by this vision of what the future of all planets might some day be."

planet "Serpens"
	landscape "land/desert5"
	description "Serpens is a sparsely populated world of ancient canyonlands and barren deserts. There were no permanent settlements here until a century ago when visiting biologists discovered an indigenous snake whose venom is useful as a painkiller and heart medication. That led to a few small laboratories being set up in the desert, and to the eventually discovery of other useful compounds that can be extracted from the local flora and fauna."
	spaceport "The spaceport's landing pads are just a set of flat cleared areas on top of a mesa, surrounding a jumble of small adobe buildings. Inside the spaceport, scientists in lab coats rub shoulders with ''snake wranglers'' who ride in and out on horseback, dressed in denim and wearing oversized straw hats. The whole place smells of antiseptic and manure."

planet "Shangri-La"
	landscape "land/sea6"
	description "Named after a mythical paradise, Shangri-La is an almost ideal planet, with a mixture of advanced, developed cities and uninhabited mountains. It is a rich and prosperous world, and nearly self-sufficient, but the cost of living here is prohibitively expensive for anyone from off-world. Because Polaris is on the very fringe of human space, and because of the wealth of its economy, piracy is a constant threat. Although recently the Syndicate has provided good protection, in past centuries it was not unheard of for raiding parties of starships to attack major port cities here, carrying off valuable cargo and sometimes also human slaves."
	spaceport "The spaceport is state-of-the-art. So are the laser turrets and missile silos spaced out along its periphery. But somehow, instead of making you feel more secure, the defenses only serve to remind you of how far on the fringes of civilization you are, and of how rich this planet is compared to some of its neighbors. Everyone walking through the port is moving at a brisk, purposeful pace; loitering and sightseeing are not encouraged here."

planet "Shiver"
	landscape "land/snow8"
	description "Shiver is a dead and frozen world. The only settlement is a small refueling station that services cargo fleets on their way to Earth. Precipitation is rare here, but sometimes the wind whips up snow and ice from the surface into something akin to a desert sandstorm, and even on days when the wind dies down the air sparkles with tiny, floating ice crystals. Most people who come here for work only stay for a few months or half a year, just long enough for the sense of adventure to die away."
	spaceport "The spaceport is protected from the wind and blowing snow by a perimeter wall about fifty meters tall. Aside from running the fueling station, one of the few jobs for the workers here is to operate the bulldozers that push away the snowdrifts and keep the station from being buried beneath them. Although the air is breathable, ships that land here connect directly to docking tubes, to protect their crews from the icy air."
	spaceport "	There are no children here, and almost no women. Most of the workers are men in their early twenties, and no one makes an effort to greet you."

planet "Shorebreak"

	description "Shorebreak is an ocean world which is home to a stunning profusion of alien life, some of which is not too dissimilar from life on earth. The first settlement, centuries ago, was built as a marine biology laboratory, and from there the planet gradually grew into a regional center for bioengineering, where local life forms are tested for possible use in human medicine."
	description "	Outside the laboratories, much of the planet's land mass remains in its natural state, but the planet is currently struggling with a large increase in immigration."
	spaceport "The spaceport on Shorebreak is built on its own separate island, perhaps as a way to keep any contamination isolated from the main continents. The hangar where you were directed to land your ship was hermetically sealed before you were allowed to land, and the customs officer informs you that any cargo you wish to trade must first be screened for ''rats, mice, invasive insects, or wild pigs.''"

planet "Shroud"
	landscape "land/mountain1"
	description "Shroud is a world of castles in the clouds and slums in the valleys below. High on the mountain peaks, above the clouds, the planets few elites live in splendid mansions. Below them, the people work mostly in textiles: farming cotton, raising sheep, working at looms and sewing machines in dimly lit factories."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is a shopping mall. You landed on a plain cement slab near the ''cargo entrance,'' where raw goods are bought and sold. But the other end of the building holds hangars for luxury ships and glass-windowed storefronts where mannequins are dressed in outlandish and horribly impractical outfits. There is a sparse cafeteria for dock workers near your entrance, and fancy steakhouses and seafood places for the more wealthy visitors."

planet "Skillet"
	landscape "land/canyon3"
	description "Skillet is a sparsely populated planet whose red hills and canyonlands are strip mined for placer deposits of iron ore and precious metals, mostly to supply the needs of the shipyards in Betelgeuse. This world is also used for ranching, and even for growing corn in a few less arid regions. The weather is usually quite mild, although hot and dry; the only reasons so few people have settled here are because it is so remote, and because the mining and farming industries need far fewer human workers than machines."
	spaceport "The spaceport mostly consists of a row of adobe warehouses, with tin roofs polished to mirror brightness to reflect the heat of the sun. Around the warehouses is a ring of concrete landing pads. Forklift trucks carrying pallets of iron and steel ingots weave their way in between men and women on horseback and others on foot. The air is hot, but too dry to feel oppressive."

planet "Skymoot"
	landscape "land/sky5"
	description "The ''dragons'' of Skymoot are an immensely popular tourist attraction, unlike their mythical namesakes only in their lack of ability to breathe fire. The presence of such an efficient apex predator has spurred the evolution of a stunning variety of defense mechanisms in its prey, as well; whether in the air or in the plains or deep in the forest, Skymoot is a dangerous place to visit."
	description "	The scientific consensus is that the ''dragons'' are clever animals, but not sentient. Those who insist on trying to find ways to communicate with them almost invariably end up getting eaten."
	spaceport "The spaceport is unusually large and clean for a planet with such a low population. It is clear that tourism here is a profitable industry. One large booth offers airplane rides to view the ''dragons'' up close, for anyone willing to sign a waiver; even with energy shields, it is not unheard of for a plane to be snatched out of midair by one of the creatures. Other booths offer safari tours of the forest; the tourists in line at those booths are carrying a wide variety of knives and guns."

planet "Solace"
	landscape "land/valley6"
	description "Solace is a fertile world that was already home to Earth-like vegetation and animals even before the first settlers arrived. It has now been inhabited for nearly half a millennium, and sprawling cities cover much of its surface."
	description "	In addition to being one of the major metropolitan centers of the galactic South, Solace is best known as the home of Delta V Corporation, makers of plasma engines and rockets of various sorts."
	spaceport "The spaceport on Solace served not only for incoming and outgoing commerce, but also as a testing ground for the next generation of Delta V technology. On your way around the port you stop to watch some tests of engines so powerful that the ground shakes beneath them."
	spaceport "At the heart of the spaceport are a few bars, plus restaurants representing nearly every style of cuisine that you are familiar with. All the buildings are well maintained; this strikes you as a quite prosperous world, for this section of the galaxy."

planet "Splashdown"
	landscape "land/water5"
	description "Splashdown is an aging world where plate tectonics have long since died down and the weather has worn the surface down into lowlands, marshes, and shallow seas. Most of the land area is not suitable for growing anything but rice, and only a few settlements have been built here. Most visitors find this world boring, but the locals say they find beauty in the big sky and the subtle colors of the grasslands."
	spaceport "The spaceport is in the ''highlands,'' a wide plateau only a few hundred meters above sea level. In all directions, the horizon is an almost perfectly flat line, varied only slightly by low hills and copses of trees. The port itself consists of some grain silos and warehouses, an open air marketplace, and a barbecue restaurant with outdoor seating. The buildings are all single-story, wood-framed construction."

planet "Starcross"
	landscape "land/sky1"
	description "Starcross is a stormy, ocean-dappled planet that was not settled until the planets farther out on this arm of the galaxy grew prosperous enough to create a need for a stop-over point for cargo. Structures must be built strong and on high enough ground to avoid the frequent floods. A few enterprising settlers have taken up farming of some native plants that are edible for humans, including one plant similar to cranberries that has come to be considered a rare delicacy by many."
	spaceport "The spaceport is rudimentary: just a couple of landing pads, each with thick cement walls around it to protect your ship from being buffeted by any storms that strike. The central building is a squat, windowless cement fortress. Inside, however, it is completely different: the ceilings are high, with sun-lights that provide some sense of warmth and cheer, and native wood paneling or stucco on most of the walls to soften them."

planet "Stormhold"
	landscape "land/fog3"
	description "A cold planet, with dense, foggy atmosphere. As with many pirate outposts, Stormhold is home to an unknown number of villages and hidden outposts, each controlled by a different pirate faction. It is also said that some of the most dangerous fugitives in the galaxy live deep in the forests of this planet, escaping detection by living underground or by avoiding the use of electronic devices."
	spaceport "The spaceport is a large town, with a population of roughly thirty thousand. People of all races and cultures mingle freely, while keeping a wary eye open for off-worlders who may be Republic agents in disguise."

planet "Sundive"
	landscape "land/water1"
	description "Sundive is largely covered in tropical rainforests and savanna, but with enough open plains that it has also become a major agricultural world. For most of the year, the weather here is quite mild, but tornadoes and massive thunderstorms are not uncommon in the summer months."
	description "	Sundive is also home to a large astronomical laboratory with radio telescopes and other devices for studying the galactic core and the massive black hole that resides there."
	spaceport "The spaceport is in a wide, open plain; most of the landing sites are just packet dirt. Surrounding it is nothing but farmland and forests; the laboratory and telescopes are far beyond the horizon, where incoming ships will not interfere with their operation."
	spaceport "	The buildings are short and made of wood; even the roofs are clapboard shingles rather than metal or rubber. Several farmers have brought in goods to sell; most of them came in trucks, but you also see a few horse-drawn wagons."

planet "Sundrinker"
	landscape "land/desert6"
	description "Most of this world is barren deserts and oceans; for whatever reason almost no life evolved here. The only human settlement is a small town in one of the few hilly regions, and the locals survive by ranching and farming. It is the sort of world that is ideal for people who enjoy being alone, because it has almost no appeal for anyone else. In addition to the oppressively hot weather, flash floods are quite frequent."
	spaceport "There are only two concrete landing platforms in the spaceport, and that is plenty for the amount of traffic they receive. A wide cleared-off field of dirt is available beyond that in case an unusual number of ships ever need to land. The two platforms and the spaceport buildings are all built near to the tops of the hills, out of the way of the flood waters. This is both the spaceport and the only town on Sundrinker. A single road winds between the buildings; one seems to be a saloon, and another, a general store."

planet "Sunracer"
	landscape "land/valley6"
	description "Sunracer is home of Megaparsec, Inc., a shipyard that specializes in designing fast, lightweight ships. It is a well-settled planet with a population of nearly half a billion, and a diverse economy that includes farming and fishing in addition to the shipyards. Outside the cities, large regions of undeveloped land still remain."
	spaceport "On Sunracer, the spaceport and shipyard are one and the same. As you walk among the landing pads and hangars, it is not immediately clear which ships are visiting starships undergoing minor repairs, and which are new ones under construction. A series of enormous cranes tower over one section of landing pads. From them hang hull fragments, engines, and even a few small ships, each being swung from one location within the shipyard to another. Meanwhile, forklifts and flatbed truck are weaving between the buildings in every direction."

planet "Thrall"
	landscape "land/fields5"
	description "Thrall has a warm, moderate climate and a geography of mostly gently rolling hills. Most of the industry here takes the form of agriculture, especially growing cotton. There are also three major cities where the cotton is spun into thread and woven into textiles for export off world. It is one of the few places in the galaxy where cotton is picked by hand, because labor here is cheaper than the cost of buying and maintaining machinery."
	spaceport "The spaceport consists of a vast asphalt-paved field for landing ships, and some wooden buildings a few stories tall. Most of the materials for export are stored in sheds or stacked under plastic tarps, with a few police officers clustered around them to make sure no ship picks up cargo that has not been paid for. Inside the buildings, two restaurants with different names serve an identical selection of fried foods."

planet "Thule"
	landscape "land/valley3"
	description "Thule is a mountainous world with a population of nearly a billion, settled in the early days of space exploration. When the colony was first established, the Earth government did not yet have the strength to control any system but its own, and when the Republic was formed, Thule did not join, and has repulsed all efforts to force them to do so. It is well-known that the planet sponsors pirate fleets which bring it cheap materials to bolster its economy, but the planet is so far from the center of Republic space that fighting a war here would be prohibitively expensive, and so they remain unopposed."
	spaceport "The inhabitants of Thule are notoriously suspicious of strangers. They all seem to immediately recognize you as an off-worlder, perhaps by your clothing or your accent. The food sold in the shops is like nothing you have seen elsewhere, and the natives' accents are so strong that they almost seem to be speaking a different language. You feel as if you are visiting an alien world; centuries of separation has created a culture here that is very different from your own."

planet "Thunder"
	landscape "land/snow7"
	description "When the first colonists landed, they thought that they had found a dream world on Thunder: perfect gravity, perfect temperature, perfect atmosphere. Unfortunately, they soon discovered that the planet has unusually high tectonic activity, enough that building anything higher than two stories is almost impossible. Because of the earthquakes, attracting settlers has always been difficult for Thunder, and right now the population is only a few million."
	spaceport "The spaceport's landing pads are all solid slabs of metal; poured concrete would be far too prone to cracking. The spaceport village itself is a sprawling collection of squat, sturdy buildings, and a sign near the entrance to the cargo warehouse reads, ''Do not stack crates.''"

planet "Tinker"
	landscape "land/city8"
	description "Tinker is a highly industrialized world, exporting electronics both to the Syndicate and to Earth. The electronic goods manufactured here span the gamut from wires and capacitors to sophisticated microchips, and because many of the jobs here require skilled labor, it is a relatively prosperous planet."
	description "	Outside the cities, large areas of this world have been set aside for mining and for refineries and smelters, ensuring that the industries here have all the raw materials they need, plus extra to sell."
	spaceport "The spaceport is nearly five hundred years old. As with many ports from that era, it is constructed as a single large complex, a towering building with hangar bay openings on all levels and a dedicated crew of flight controllers directing incoming starships in order to avoid collisions. Around the spaceport a city has developed."

planet "Trinket"
	landscape "land/beach3"
	description "In a region of the galaxy not known for beach resorts, Trinket has become somewhat of a major tourist destination. It is not a particularly warm world, and near both poles icebergs float year round, but at the equator the weather is almost tropical and the water is warm enough for swimming. Occasionally one of the ocean currents will pick up an iceberg and carry it all the way down past the resorts before it melts completely; taking a boat out to these icebergs is a popular daytime activity here."
	spaceport "The spaceport is a long, two-story building of wood and stone with hundreds of stalls selling fruit and clothing and bad artwork. Many of the starships that are landed here have scorch marks and dents on their hulls, a sure sign of recent battle. It is likely that some of the people walking through the port are in fact pirates, posing as civilians in order to sell stolen cargo or to take a vacation incognito."

planet "Trove"
	landscape "land/badlands3"
	description "Trove is a tiny moon, too small to have a breathable atmosphere. It is home to an experimental ''jack mining'' operation that has split is surface open in order to gain access to the metal-rich core. Most of the work here is done by machines, but a few people live inside an airtight complex in order to supervise the work and to sell ore and metal to visiting ships."
	spaceport "Within the mining complex, you find a small cafeteria with an uninspiring menu, and windows overlooking offices where dozens of people are staring at flickering video screens. Because of the low gravity, everyone moves languidly, as if in a dream. It is nearly silent."

planet "Twinstar"
	landscape "land/lava3"
	description "The only settlement on this small world is Twinstar Depot, a village created mostly just to service the spaceport, where food and equipment from the southern galactic arm is stored and sent out in all directions to supply the rest of human space. The gravity is far less than ideal for human development, but the atmosphere is breathable and some tourists come to the planet just for the experience of being able to run and jump in low gravity without the need for a suit or oxygen tanks."
	spaceport "The depot consists mostly of large storage racks, with automatic lifts constantly clanking up and down. Very few people are in sight, aside from a small cafe near the center of the port. It is not a hospitable place."

planet "Winter"
	landscape "land/snow3"
	description "The dense clouds in Winter's atmosphere block out much of the sunlight, creating a frigid landscape below. The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Pherkad decided to build a manufacturing center here, rather than trying to find more land on the already overcrowded planet of Solace. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going."
	description "	The temperatures have risen measurably since the arrival of the human colonists, but without more intentional efforts it may be another century before the planet warms enough to be truly comfortable to live on."
	spaceport "The spaceport is built on a large rock outcropping, with brilliant blue glaciers flowing to either side down into a lake below. The sight is stunning, and all the more appealing because you are able to view it from behind plate glass windows, in the warmth of the spaceport, rather than in the frigid air outside. Above you, several layers of clouds are scudding across the sky in different directions."

planet "Zenith"
	landscape "land/water4"
	description "Zenith is a cold and unpleasant world, where the fog seldom lifts and the sun is rarely seen, where much of the lowlands are flooded each day by the tide, and storms are unpredictable and fierce. It has, however, one major advantage as a place to settle: it is far enough away that the Republic makes no attempt to control it."
	description "	Several villages have been founded near the equator, and in addition there are an unknown number of private holdings, ranging from underground bunkers to enormous cement fortresses. Because the land is owned by no government and anyone can build a dwelling without permission or paperwork as long as they are willing to fight off any other claimants, the total population of Zenith is unknown."
	spaceport "To create a spaceport for Zenith, one enterprising privateer a few centuries ago used a mixture of explosives and heavy machinery to shift the top of one of the tallest mountains down into the neighboring valleys, creating a high plateau that is (usually) above the fog line. There are landing pads both for starships like yours and for airships that carry cargo to and from the settlements elsewhere on the planet. The port is nearly deserted, however; it is clear that they do not do much business here."

planet "Zug"
	landscape "land/city4"
	description "Zug is a pleasant world of rolling hills, fertile fields, and a few small oceans. Hundreds of millions of people live here, with more immigrants arriving every day, almost faster than the construction industry can keep up with them. In addition to the larger cities, many people live in smaller farming villages, making this one of the few worlds in the region that is truly self-sufficient both in industry and in agriculture."
	spaceport "The spaceport of Zug has been growing by amalgamation for centuries. At its core is the ''Old Port,'' a set of quaint and rudimentary shops and warehouses. The landing pads for the Old Port were torn up to make room for what the locals call ''The Port,'' a set of buildings that were constructed a century ago, with bolder architecture and more modern design. Some distance away is the ''New Port,'' a towering structure with robotic cargo lifts and large hangars for more expensive ships. Meanwhile, plans are apparently underway for an expansion of the New Port. YOu can't help but wonder what the new expansion will be named."
