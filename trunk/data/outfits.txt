	description "This mysterious box sits quietly at the heart of your ship, thinking its own inscrutable thoughts. When it come time to travel between the stars, it sets off a nuclear fusion reaction powerful enough to level an entire city, then somehow tucks the resulting explosion in between the folds of regular space-time like a wasp stinging an oak leaf to lay her eggs inside. Your ship rides the resulting ripple in the fabric of space."
	description "	They say that fewer than a dozen human beings alive today understand the inner workings of the hyperdrive."
