	description "This mysterious box sits quietly at the heart of your ship, thinking its own inscrutable thoughts. When it come time to travel between the stars, it sets off a nuclear fusion reaction powerful enough to level an entire city, then somehow tucks the resulting explosion in between the folds of regular space-time like a wasp stinging an oak leaf to lay her eggs inside. Your ship rides the resulting ripple in the fabric of space."

	description "A laser rifle is a step up from the sidearms that crew members typically carry for defense against pirates: more powerful, and more accurate as well. For each of these rifles that one of your crew is wielding, your odds of capturing another ship or defending your own ship fromboarders are increased substantially."
