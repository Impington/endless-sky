	cost 10000
	thumbnail "outfit/steering"
	"mass" 5
	"outfit space" 5
	"energy generation" -.1
	"heat generation" -5
	description "When trying to cram as many high-powered outfits as possible into a ship, occasionally you reach the point where it is sporadically overheating and shutting down. In that case, you may need to install one of these."

outfit "Water Coolant System"

	cost 25000
	thumbnail "outfit/steering"
	"mass" 10
	"outfit space" 10
	"energy generation" -.2
	"heat generation" -12
	description "This system is a step up from ordinary cooling ducts; it circulates water in between an external radiator and your ship's hottest internal components to keep them from overheating."

	cost 60000
	thumbnail "outfit/steering"
	"mass" 20
	"outfit space" 20
	"energy generation" -.4
	"heat generation" -29
	description "For ships with extreme cooling needs, liquid nitrogen is the answer. One of these coolers will dissipate the heat produced by anything but the heaviest of armaments."

	cost 150000
	thumbnail "outfit/steering"
	"mass" 40
	"outfit space" 40
	"energy generation" -.8
	"heat generation" -69
	description "Liquid helium is the ultimate in cooling technology. Given how much space this cooling system takes up, you may be better off just installing more efficient, low-heat components instead, but where that is not an option, this cooler can handle almost anything you throw at it."


outfit "D14-RN Shield Generator"
	category "Systems"
	cost 20000
	thumbnail "outfit/tiny shield"
	"mass" 15
	"outfit space" -15
	"shield generation" .2
	description "This is the standard shield generator for fighters and interceptors, as well as for many non-combat starships. Although it is possible for a ship to have no shield generator at all, recharging its shield matrix only when landed in a hospitable spaceport, life in deep space is unpredictable enough that most pilots find shield generators to be well worth the space they take up."

outfit "D23-QP Shield Generator"
	category "Systems"
	cost 35000
	thumbnail "outfit/small shield"
	"mass" 22
	"outfit space" -22
	"shield generation" .32
	description "This is a slightly more powerful shield generator than the standard model installed in most small ships. If combat lasts long enough, the increased recharge rate is enough to give you an edge, but recharging your shields completely will still take a long time."

outfit "D41-HY Shield Generator"
	category "Systems"
	cost 65000
	thumbnail "outfit/medium shield"
	"mass" 30
	"outfit space" -30
	"shield generation" .51
	description "This is a more powerful shield generator designed for ships that are likely to see frequent combat, or that have such a large shield capacity that recharging them would take a long time with a smaller generator."

outfit "D67-TM Shield Generator"
	category "Systems"
	cost 120000
	thumbnail "outfit/large shield"
	"mass" 45
	"outfit space" -45
	"shield generation" .82
	description "This shield generator is powerful enough that in combat against some particularly weak ships, they may not even be capable of depleting your shields as fast as they recharge."

outfit "D94-YV Shield Generator"
	category "Systems"
	cost 200000
	thumbnail "outfit/huge shield"
	"mass" 60
	"outfit space" -60
	"shield generation" 1.31
	description "This is the most powerful shield generator available in human space. Because of their large size, D94-YV shield generators are mostly used in large warships, but you can fit one in a smaller ship if you are willing to sacrifice engine power or weaponry to make space for it."


outfit "Ramscoop"
	category "Systems"
	cost 60000
	thumbnail "outfit/ramscoop"
	"mass" 10
	"outfit space" -10
	"ramscoop" 1
	In the early days of space exploration, when ships could travel through half a dozen systems before encountering an established colony where they could refuel, ramscoops were an essential piece of equipment, harvesting plasma from the solar wind to refil your hyperspace fuel tanks. Although you can install more than one ramscoop, additional ramscoops on a single ship are not as effective as the first."

outfit "Hyperdrive"

	"mass" 20
	"outfit space" -20
	"jump fuel" 100
	"hyperdrive" 1
	description "This mysterious box sits quietly at the heart of your ship, thinking its own inscrutable thoughts. When it come time to travel between the stars, it sets off a nuclear fusion reaction powerful enough to level an entire city, then somehow tucks the resulting explosion in between the folds of regular space-time like a wasp stinging an oak leaf to lay her eggs inside. Your ship rides the resulting ripple in the fabric of space."
	description "	They say that fewer than a dozen human beings alive today understand the inner workings of the hyperdrive."

	cost 8000

	"mass" 1
	"outfit space" -1
	"cargo scan" 300
	description "This scanner allows you to scan the cargo holds of the ship you are currently targeting, as long as you are flying close enough to it. Patrol craft use cargo scanners to detect illegal contraband."

outfit "Outfit Scanner"
	category "Systems"
	cost 24000
	thumbnail "outfit/small shield"
	"mass" 2
	"outfit space" -2
	"outfit scan" 500
	description "This scanner allows you to determine what outfits are installed in the ship you are currently targeting, if you are willing to risk flying close enough to it to get a reading! The Republic Navy uses these scanners to detect when ships are equipped with illegal weaponry."

outfit "Surveillance Pod"
	category "Systems"
	cost 42000

	"mass" 5
	"outfit space" -5
	"outfit scan" 400
	"cargo scan" 200
	"atmosphere scan" 100
	description "This is Republic military technology, a collection of scanners designed to fit perfectly inside one of their surveillance drones. Since the outputs are fairly standard, you could connect it to your own ship's systems if you want."


outfit "Laser Rifle"
	category "Hand to Hand"
	cost 8000
	thumbnail "outfit/laser rifle"
	"capture attack" .6
	"capture defense" .8
	description "A laser rifle is a step up from the sidearms that crew members typically carry for defense against pirates: more powerful, and more accurate as well. For each of these rifles that one of your crew is wielding, your odds of capturing another ship or defending your own ship from boarders are increased substantially."

outfit "Fragmentation Grenades"
	category "Hand to Hand"
	cost 17000
	thumbnail "outfit/fragmentation grenades"
	"capture attack" 1.3
	"capture defense" .3
	description "Fragmentation grenades are an only marginally legal weapon for hand-to-hand combat when boarding a ship, useful for flushing out defenders who are hunkered down in defensible choke points inside their own ship. They are much less useful as a defensive weapon, but still better than nothing."

outfit "Security Station"
	category "Hand to Hand"
	cost 42000
	thumbnail "outfit/security station"
	"mass" 2
	"outfit space" -2
	"capture defense" 3.4
	description "This is a specially designed barricade, which can be installed in the hallways of your ship as a powerful defense against anyone who boards you in an attempt to take over your ship."

outfit "Nerve Gas"
	category "Hand to Hand"
	cost 75000
	thumbnail "outfit/nerve gas"
	"capture attack" 2.8
	"capture defense" .8
	description "This is a highly illegal weapon for hand to hand combat when boarding an enemy ship. Because chemical weapons are banned by interstellar law, you can be severely fined for getting caught in possession of nerve gas cannisters. But, they do clear out an enemy ship quicker than just about anything else..."
