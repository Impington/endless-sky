	description "This is the smallest thruster that you can buy, so weak that anything larger than a drone will accelerate quite slowly when using this engine. On the other hand, it is also very energy-efficient."

		"frame rate" 1.1
	description "The X2700 ion thruster is intended mostly for use in small, single-person or two-person ships, as well as in fighters. It is also used in larger ships, such as freighters, that have very little space for propulsion systems or energy to drive them. But these larger ships move unbearably slowly as a result."

	description "The X3700 ion thruster is designed for heavy freighters and small capital ships. In theory, it could be installed in smaller ships too, if they have enough engine space, to attain almost ridiculous speeds."

		"frame rate" 0.9
	description "The X4700 ion thruster was developed when the Republic Navy began building warships so large that the X3700 was not sufficient for them. It allows even a warship to move at a respectable speed, but also requires an enormous amount of engine space."

		"frame rate" 0.8
	description "No ship has yet been built that comes with an X5700 installed by default, so it is widely considered to be nothing more than a publicity stunt on the part of the Syndicate, a demonstration model simply designed to wow people. With this engine, a bulk freighter with a fully loaded cargo bay could outrace a Sparrow."

	description "This is the smallest set of steering thrusters that you can buy, generally considered suitable only for tiny, pilotless drones. Occasionally pilots looking for some extra outfit space will try swapping out their larger steering systems for one of these, but the results are invariably disappointing."

	description "The X3200 steering system is intended for capital ships and large freighters. It produces enough turning force to lend agility to all but the largest of human ships, and it is considerably more energy-efficient than the plasma-drive alternatives."

	description "The enormous crate that this thruster is sold in comes decorated with a picture of a grinning Tyrannosaurus Rex with an improbable number of teeth. You have never heard of a ship large enough to even be able to fit this engine inside it, not to mention that it would take the entire energy output of a nuclear reactor just to power it."
