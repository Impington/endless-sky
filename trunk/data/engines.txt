	description "The X2700 ion thruster is intended mostly for use in small, single-person or two-person ships, as well as in fighters. It is also used in larger ships, such as freighters, that have very little space for propulsion systems or energy to drive them. But these larger ships move unbearably slowly as a result."

	description "The X3700 ion thruster is designed for heavy freighters and small capital ships. In theory, it could be installed in smaller ships too, if they have enough engine space, to attain almost ridiculous speeds."

	description "The X4700 ion thruster was developed when the Republic Navy began building warships so large that the X3700 was not sufficient for them. It allows even a capital ship to move at a respectable speed."

	description "The X5700 thruster is intended for only the largest of capital ships. When the Syndicate first began producing them, these engines were considered little more than a publicity stunt, because no ship at the time was large enough to hold one."

	description "This is the smallest set of steering thrusters that you can buy, generally considered suitable only for tiny, pilotless drones. Occasionally pilots looking for some extra outfit space will try swapping out their larger steering systems for one of these, but the results are invariably disappointing."

	description "The X3200 steering system is intended for small warships ships and freighters. It produces enough turning force to lend agility to all but the largest of human ships, and it is considerably more energy-efficient than the plasma-drive alternatives."

	description "The X5200 is a steering system so powerful that only a handful of ships use it. It is standard equipment for Republic cruisers and carriers, ships so large that they are practically a self-contained city."

	description "This engine draws enough power that a ship with anything short of a full-fledged nuclear reactor is unlikely to be able to use it, but the thrust it generates is impressive."
