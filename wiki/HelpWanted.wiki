#summary List of things that need doing

= Non-programming tasks =

  * Audio: create a set of higher-quality sound effects, or work on better volume balancing of the current ones. The sound effects should be subtle so that they don't get annoying.

  * Photography: contribute or find open-source photos for planet landscapes or conversation "scenes." Especially cool would be some "matte paintings" or 3D renderings of the inside of futuristic space stations.

  * Creating new aliens: each species should have a different set of ships and weapons, and a story line to go with them.

  * Missions: writing new side missions either to go with the main story lines, or completely independent of them.

  * Editing: fixing boring or badly written parts of the planet descriptions or mission text.

= Programming tasks =

  * Windows: port to Windows and make an official installer, etc.

  * Mac OS X: build and distribute each release.

  * Linux: Debian package maintainer.

= Testing =

  * Try different operating systems, including various Linux distributions and different Mac and Windows versions.

  * Play-test the missions to find any confusing or broken parts.

  * Balancing of weapons and other equipment: decide whether some are currently over-powered or under-powered.

  * Economic balancing: are there stages of the game where making money feels too easy or too difficult? Are the various ways to make money equally good: trade routes vs. missions vs. fighting pirates?
